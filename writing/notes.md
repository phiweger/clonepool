## Notes

risk score 1-4, aim: reduce saturation of plate w/ positive pools:

- screening 4
- contact 3
- longer contact 2
- symptoms 1

can we identify which samples need retesting to resolve rest?

### TODO


stuff:

- fit lines into each p value (0.1, 0.2 ...) -- no jitter -- rstan?
- number of positive pools for addresslen, p, nsamples
- incentivises screening -- the more negative samples expected, the better
- plot: number of samples per well (dilution at some point of PCR? vacuum centrifugation a solution maybe? what's the typical ct value for covid? bc/ each sample reduces this by 1 right?)
- carry over samples poisson distribution -- how long is it likely that a sample is not resolved? like what's the prob that a sample is carried over 3, 4, 5 times etc. -- at some point direct testing needed
- only 94 wells bc/ pos an dneg control
- pooling always assumes we have time for 2 PCRs
- pooling only makes sense if a large portion negative
- propagating error by doing 2 PCRs (technical replication PCR -- coV? not same as "nasal swab sensitivity only 0.3 -- would still be negative in 2nd test") -- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779918303421
