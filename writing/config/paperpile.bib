                   represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes
                   to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is
                   bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words
                   features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering
                   of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words.
                   For example, ``powerful,'' ``strong'' and ``Paris'' are
                   equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector,

  abstract      = "Current deep learning architectures are growing larger in
                   order to learn from complex datasets. These architectures
                   require giant matrix multiplication operations to train
                   millions of parameters. Conversely, there is another growing
                   trend to bring deep learning to low-power, embedded devices.
                   The matrix operations, associated with both training and
                   testing of deep networks, are very expensive from a
                   computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel
                   hashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of
                   computation needed to train and test deep networks. Our
                   approach combines recent ideas from adaptive dropouts and
                   randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to
                   select the nodes with the highest activation efficiently.
                   Our new algorithm for deep learning reduces the overall
                   computational cost of forward and back-propagation by
                   operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a
                   consequence, our algorithm uses only 5\% of the total
                   multiplications, while keeping on average within 1\% of the
                   accuracy of the original model. A unique property of the
                   proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates
                   are always sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our
                   algorithm is ideally suited for asynchronous and parallel
                   training leading to near linear speedup with increasing
                   number of cores. We demonstrate the scalability and
                   sustainability (energy efficiency) of our proposed algorithm

                   field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) suggested to
                   learn a latent representation of words using neural
                   embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with

                   typically produces only genome fragments, also known as
                   contigs, instead of entire genome, it is crucial to group
                   them into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for further
                   taxonomic profiling and down-streaming functional analysis.
                   OTU clustering is also referred to as binning. We present
                   COCACOLA, a general framework automatically bin contigs into
                   OTUs based upon sequence composition and coverage across
                   multiple samples. The effectiveness of COCACOLA is
                   demonstrated in both simulated and real datasets in
                   comparison to state-of-art binning approaches such as
                   CONCOCT, GroopM, MaxBin and MetaBAT. The superior
                   performance of COCACOLA relies on two aspects. One is
                   employing $L_\{1\}$ distance instead of Euclidean distance
                   for better taxonomic identification during initialization.
                   More importantly, COCACOLA takes advantage of both hard
                   clustering and soft clustering by sparsity regularization.
                   In addition, the COCACOLA framework seamlessly embraces
                   customized knowledge to facilitate binning accuracy. In our
                   study, we have investigated two types of additional
                   knowledge, the co-alignment to reference genomes and linkage
                   of contigs provided by paired-end reads, as well as the
                   ensemble of both. We find that both co-alignment and linkage

                   the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to

                   methods that extends the idea of word embeddings to other
                   types of high-dimensional data. As examples, we studied
                   neural data with real-valued observations, count data from a
                   market basket analysis, and ratings data from a movie
                   recommendation system. The main idea is to model each
                   observation conditioned on a set of other observations. This
                   set is called the context, and the way the context is
                   defined is a modeling choice that depends on the problem. In
                   language the context is the surrounding words; in
                   neuroscience the context is close-by neurons; in market
                   basket data the context is other items in the shopping cart.
                   Each type of embedding model defines the context, the
                   exponential family of conditional distributions, and how the
                   latent embedding vectors are shared across data. We infer
                   the embeddings with a scalable algorithm based on stochastic

                   the Jaccard index (or Jaccard similarity coefficient) over
                   two sets $A$ and $B$. HyperMinHash can be thought of as a
                   compression of standard MinHash by building off of a
                   HyperLogLog count-distinct sketch. Given Jaccard index
                   $\delta$, using $k$ buckets of size $O(\log(l) + \log\log(|A
                   \cup B|))$ (in practice, typically 2 bytes) per set,
                   HyperMinHash streams over $A$ and $B$ and generates an
                   estimate of the Jaccard index $\delta$ with error $O(1/l +
                   \sqrt\{k/\delta\})$. This improves on the best previously
                   known sketch, MinHash, which requires the same number of
                   storage units (buckets), but using $O(\log(|A \cup B|))$ bit
                   per bucket. For instance, our new algorithm allows
                   estimating Jaccard indices of 0.01 for set cardinalities on
                   the order of $10^\{19\}$ with relative error of around 5\%
                   using 64KiB of memory; the previous state-of-the-art MinHash
                   can only estimate Jaccard indices for cardinalities of
                   $10^\{10\}$ with the same memory consumption. Alternately,
                   one can think of HyperMinHash as an augmentation of b-bit
                   MinHash that enables streaming updates, unions, and
                   cardinality estimation (and thus intersection cardinality by
                   way of Jaccard), while using $\log\log$ extra bits.",

                   data consists in inferring single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
                   or more complex differences from read alignments.
                   Consequently, variant calling is performed after all reads
                   have been mapped to a reference genome and all read
                   alignments are available. Existing variant callers usually
                   operate by first sorting the alignments in increasing order
                   of positions, and then sliding a small window through the
                   genome and processing information collected within
                   individual windows (read alignments, mapping qualities, base
                   qualities). However, this approach is highly time- and
                   space-demanding and all alignments must be available prior
                   to variant calling. Results: We present OCOCO, the first
                   online consensus caller, capable to infer SNVs dynamically
                   as read alignments are fed in. OCOCO inputs unsorted
                   alignments from an unsorted SAM/BAM stream and decides about
                   single-nucleotide updates of the current genomic consensus
                   using statistics stored in compact several-bits counters.
                   Updates are reported in the online fashion using unsorted
                   VCF. OCOCO provides a fast and memory-efficient alternative
                   to the usual variant calling, particularly advantageous when
                   reads are sequenced or mapped progressively, or when
                   available computational resources are at a premium.

                   The existing reference-based and gene homology-based methods

                   predicting viral sequences in metagenomic data using deep
                   learning techniques. DeepVirFinder was trained based on a

                   Evaluated on the sequences after that date, DeepVirFinder

              Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing
              (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November
              2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was
              developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In
              phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was
              determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample
              were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify
              pathogens other than the outbreak strain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
              MEASURES: The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes
              of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and
              other pathogens from fecal samples. RESULTS: During phase 1, a
              draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During
              phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples
              at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater
              than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were
              detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67\%). In phase 3,
              sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni,
              Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered.
              CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest the potential of
              metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the
              identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of
              diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic
              sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing
              costs.",

              produce the longest fragments. Incubation of the fragments with
              T4 DNA polymerase indicated that the 3'-ends of the proofreading
              polymerase amplicons were recessed, while the Taq amplicon was
              partially +A tailed. Treatment of the PCR product with
              proofreading DNA polymerase rendered trimmed fragments. This was
              due to the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of these enzymes, which is
              essential for proofreading. The nuclease activity was reduced by

              studies in plant molecular biology. High-quality RNA extraction
              from grapevine and other woody plants is problematic due to the
              presence of polysaccharides, polyphenolics and other compounds
              that bind or co-precipitate with the RNA. OBJECTIVE: To develop
              an optimised cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based
              protocol, to reduce the time and cost of extraction without
              reducing quality and yield of RNA extracted from
              polysaccharide-rich tissues of several plants. METHODOLOGY:
              Several changes were introduced to the original CTAB protocol.
              All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 degrees C, the
              sample weight was decreased and the concentrations of PVP-40 and
              LiCl were increased reducing incubation time prior to RNA
              precipitation. This rapid CTAB protocol was compared with six
              different RNA extraction methods from three grapevine tissues,
              namely, in vitro plantlets, and leaves and mature canes from
              actively growing field vines. RESULTS: The rapid CTAB method gave
              high-quality RNA in only 3 h at low cost with efficiency equal to
              or higher than that obtained with other time-consuming and
              expensive protocols. The procedure was applied to RNA extraction
              from other grapevine tissues and other woody species including
              olive, lemon, poplar, chestnut, apple, pear, peach, cherry,
              apricot, plum and kiwi fruit. RNA of high quality could be
              isolated from all tissues and from all species. CONCLUSION: The
              study has shown that the improvement of a CTAB-based protocol

              components of these structures. We found that on average, using
              different measures of structural change, protein cores evolve
              linearly with evolutionary distance (amino acid substitutions per
              site). This is true irrespective of which measure of structural
              change we used, whether RMSD or discrete structural descriptors

              many pathogenic bacteria. These enzymes can be detected in a
              variety of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. The
              cyanobacteria are also known to produce a beta-lactamase.
              Recently, the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional
              structures of some of these beta-lactamases have been clarified.
              On the basis of the amino acid sequences of 47 beta-lactamases
              and the computer-aided analysis, a phylogenetic tree is proposed
              in this paper. According to the tree, beta-lactamases are
              classified into six groups. Group 1 beta-lactamases are mainly
              composed of plasmid-mediated enzymes from gram-negative bacteria.
              However, chromosome-derived beta-lactamases from Klebsiella
              pneumoniae and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata take part in this
              group. Group 2 enzymes consist of a part of the
              chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from Streptomyces, and
              chromosome-mediated enzymes from Yersinia enterocolitica,
              Citrobacter diversus, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Chromosome-encoded
              beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria form group 3. Group 4
              is composed of metalloenzymes, whereas group 5 consists of OXA
              type beta-lactamases. Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from
              gram-positive bacteria form group 6. Comparison of the amino acid
              sequences among these groups confirmed the phylogenetic tree and
              the classification: the beta-lactamases in each group have its
              particular conserved amino acid sequences. In addition, the tree
              provides more detailed classification and time-scale mutual
              relationships and predicts new types of beta-lactamases that may
              be found. Furthermore, the classification deduced from the tree
              is generally in accord with the one based on the amino acid

  abstract = "Naturally occurring defective interfering RNAs have been found in
              4 of 14 coronavirus species. They range in size from 2.2 kb to
              approximately 25 kb, or 80\% of the 30-kb parent virus genome.
              The large DI RNAs do not in all cases appear to require helper
              virus for intracellular replication and it has been postulated
              that they may on their own function as agents of disease.
              Coronavirus DI RNAs appear to arise by internal deletions
              (through nonhomologous recombination events) on the virus genome
              or on DI RNAs of larger size by a polymerase strand-switching
              (copy-choice) mechanism. In addition to their use in the study of
              virus RNA replication and virus assembly, coronavirus DI RNAs are
              being used in a major way to study the mechanism of a
              high-frequency, site-specific RNA recombination event that leads
              to leader acquisition during virus replication (i.e., the leader
              fusion event that occurs during synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs,
              and the leader-switching event that can occur during DI RNA
              replication), a distinguishing feature of coronaviruses (and
              arteriviruses). Coronavirus DI RNAs are also being engineered as

              infections (SSI) are surgical debridement and local and systemic

              resistance, the development of additional therapeutic measures is
              of great interest for future trauma and orthopedic surgery.
              METHOD: Against the background of our own experimental and
              clinical experiences and on the basis of the current literature,
              possible future anti-infective strategies were elaborated.
              RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriophages were discovered and
              clinically implemented approximately one century ago and have
              been used in Western Europe for about one decade. They are
              currently used mainly in patients with burn injuries. It is
              likely that bacteriophages will become of great importance in
              view of the increasing antibiotic multi-drug resistance; however,
              they will probably not entirely replace antibiotic drugs. A
              combined use of bacteriophages and antibiotics is likely to be a
              more reasonable efficient therapy. In addition, the clinical
              importance of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) also increases. Up to
              now the possible use of AMPs is still experimental; however,
              individual AMPs are already established in the routine therapy
              (e. g. colistin). Further diagnostic and therapeutic measures may
              include photodynamic therapy, ultraviolet (UV) light application
              and differentiated genome analysis as well as the individual

               the genomic viral RNA are conserved between all influenza A
               viruses and unique for each segment. The primers designed for
               each segment contain influenza virus specific nucleotides at
               their 3′-end and non-influenza virus nucleotides at the 5′-end.
               With this set of primers, we were able to amplify all eight

  abstract = "Since the first two complete bacterial genome sequences were
              published in 1995, the science of bacteria has dramatically
              changed. Using third-generation DNA sequencing, it is possible to
              completely sequence a bacterial genome in a few hours and
              identify some types of methylation sites along the genome as
              well. Sequencing of bacterial genome sequences is now a standard
              procedure, and the information from tens of thousands of
              bacterial genomes has had a major impact on our views of the
              bacterial world. In this review, we explore a series of questions
              to highlight some insights that comparative genomics has
              produced. To date, there are genome sequences available from 50
              different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla.
              However, the distribution is quite skewed towards a few phyla
              that contain model organisms. But the breadth is continuing to
              improve, with projects dedicated to filling in less characterized
              taxonomic groups. The clustered regularly interspaced short
              palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides bacteria with
              immunity against viruses, which outnumber bacteria by tenfold.
              How fast can we go? Second-generation sequencing has produced a
              large number of draft genomes (close to 90 \% of bacterial
              genomes in GenBank are currently not complete); third-generation
              sequencing can potentially produce a finished genome in a few
              hours, and at the same time provide methlylation sites along the
              entire chromosome. The diversity of bacterial communities is
              extensive as is evident from the genome sequences available from
              50 different bacterial phyla and 11 different archaeal phyla.
              Genome sequencing can help in classifying an organism, and in the
              case where multiple genomes of the same species are available, it
              is possible to calculate the pan- and core genomes; comparison of
              more than 2000 Escherichia coli genomes finds an E. coli core
              genome of about 3100 gene families and a total of about 89,000
              different gene families. Why do we care about bacterial genome
              sequencing? There are many practical applications, such as
              genome-scale metabolic modeling, biosurveillance, bioforensics,
              and infectious disease epidemiology. In the near future,
              high-throughput sequencing of patient metagenomic samples could
              revolutionize medicine in terms of speed and accuracy of finding
              pathogens and knowing how to treat them.",

              hosts) are units of selection squares poorly with the observation
              that microbes are often recruited (horizontally acquired) from
              the environment, not passed down vertically from parent to
              offspring, as required for collective reproduction. The taxonomic
              makeup of a holobiont's microbial community may vary over its
              lifetime and differ from that of conspecifics. In contrast,
              biochemical functions of the microbiota and contributions to host
              biology are more conserved, with taxonomically variable but
              functionally similar microbes recurring across generations and
              hosts. To save what is of interest in holobiont thinking, we
              propose casting metabolic and developmental interaction patterns,
              rather than the taxa responsible for them, as units of selection.
              Such units need not directly reproduce or form parent-offspring
              lineages: their prior existence has created the conditions under
              which taxa with the genes necessary to carry out their steps have
              evolved in large numbers. These taxa or genes will reconstruct
              the original interaction patterns when favorable conditions
              occur. Interaction patterns will vary (for instance by the
              alteration or addition of intermediates) in ways that affect the
              likelihood of and circumstances under which such reconstruction
              occurs. Thus, they vary in fitness, and evolution by natural
              selection will occur at this level. It is on the persistence,
              reconstruction, and spread of such interaction patterns that
              students of holobiosis should concentrate, we suggest. This model
              also addresses other multi-species collectively beneficial

               selection for regression and classification and perform several
               numerical experiments using both simulated and real world data.
               The results show that the optimization of a utility estimate
               such as the cross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding
               overfitted models due to relatively high variance in the utility
               estimates when the data is scarce. This can also lead to
               substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the
               performance evaluation for the selected model. From a predictive
               viewpoint, best results are obtained by accounting for model
               uncertainty by forming the full encompassing model, such as the
               Bayesian model averaging solution over the candidate models. If
               the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly
               simplified by the projection method, in which the information of

               substantially less prone to overfitting than selection based on
               CV-score. Overall, the projection method appears to outperform
               also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of the
               most probable variables. The study also demonstrates that the
               model selection can greatly benefit from using cross-validation
               outside the searching process both for guiding the model size

              manufacturing facilities, the vicinity of two sewage treatment
              plants, the Musi River, and habitats in Hyderabad and nearby
              villages. Samples were analyzed for 25 anti-infective
              pharmaceuticals with liquid chromatography-tandem mass
              spectrometry and for MDR Gram-negative bacteria using chromogenic
              culture media. In addition, specimens were screened with PCR for
              bla VIM, bla KPC, bla NDM, bla IMP-1, and bla OXA-48 resistance
              genes. RESULTS: All environmental specimens from 28 different
              sampling sites were contaminated with antimicrobials. High
              concentrations of moxifloxacin, voriconazole, and fluconazole (up
              to 694.1, 2500, and 236,950 µg/L, respectively) as well as
              increased concentrations of eight other antibiotics were found in
              sewers in the Patancheru-Bollaram industrial area. Corresponding
              microbiological analyses revealed an extensive presence of
              extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing
              Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters (carrying mainly bla
              OXA-48, bla NDM, and bla KPC) in more than 95\% of the samples.
              CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient wastewater management by bulk drug
              manufacturing facilities leads to unprecedented contamination of
              water resources with antimicrobial pharmaceuticals, which seems
              to be associated with the selection and dissemination of
              carbapenemase-producing pathogens. The development and global
              spread of antimicrobial resistance present a major challenge for
              pharmaceutical producers and regulatory agencies.",

              investigated the prevalence of NDM-1, in multidrug-resistant
              Enterobacteriaceae in India, Pakistan, and the UK. METHODS:
              Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied from two major centres
              in India--Chennai (south India), Haryana (north India)--and those
              referred to the UK's national reference laboratory. Antibiotic
              susceptibilities were assessed, and the presence of the
              carbapenem resistance gene bla(NDM-1) was established by PCR.
              Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of
              XbaI-restricted genomic DNA. Plasmids were analysed by S1
              nuclease digestion and PCR typing. Case data for UK patients were
              reviewed for evidence of travel and recent admission to hospitals
              in India or Pakistan. FINDINGS: We identified 44 isolates with
              NDM-1 in Chennai, 26 in Haryana, 37 in the UK, and 73 in other
              sites in India and Pakistan. NDM-1 was mostly found among
              Escherichia coli (36) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (111), which were
              highly resistant to all antibiotics except to tigecycline and
              colistin. K pneumoniae isolates from Haryana were clonal but
              NDM-1 producers from the UK and Chennai were clonally diverse.
              Most isolates carried the NDM-1 gene on plasmids: those from UK
              and Chennai were readily transferable whereas those from Haryana
              were not conjugative. Many of the UK NDM-1 positive patients had
              travelled to India or Pakistan within the past year, or had links

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic drug consumption is a major driver of
              antibiotic resistance. Variations in antibiotic resistance across
              countries are attributable, in part, to different volumes and
              patterns for antibiotic consumption. We aimed to assess
              variations in consumption to assist monitoring of the rise of
              resistance and development of rational-use policies and to
              provide a baseline for future assessment. METHODS: With use of
              sales data for retail and hospital pharmacies from the IMS Health
              MIDAS database, we reviewed trends for consumption of standard
              units of antibiotics between 2000 and 2010 for 71 countries. We
              used compound annual growth rates to assess temporal differences
              in consumption for each country and Fourier series and regression
              methods to assess seasonal differences in consumption in 63 of
              the countries. FINDINGS: Between 2000 and 2010, consumption of
              antibiotic drugs increased by 36\% (from 54 083 964 813 standard
              units to 73 620 748 816 standard units). Brazil, Russia, India,
              China, and South Africa accounted for 76\% of this increase. In
              most countries, antibiotic consumption varied significantly with
              season. There was increased consumption of carbapenems (45\%) and
              polymixins (13\%), two last-resort classes of antibiotic drugs.
              INTERPRETATION: The rise of antibiotic consumption and the
              increase in use of last-resort antibiotic drugs raises serious
              concerns for public health. Appropriate use of antibiotics in
              developing countries should be encouraged. However, to prevent a
              striking rise in resistance in low-income and middle-income
              countries with large populations and to preserve antibiotic
              efficacy worldwide, programmes that promote rational use through
              coordinated efforts by the international community should be a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Until now, polymyxin resistance has involved
              chromosomal mutations but has never been reported via horizontal
              gene transfer. During a routine surveillance project on
              antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from food
              animals in China, a major increase of colistin resistance was
              observed. When an E coli strain, SHP45, possessing colistin
              resistance that could be transferred to another strain, was
              isolated from a pig, we conducted further analysis of possible
              plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance. Herein, we report the
              emergence of the first plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance
              mechanism, MCR-1, in Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: The mcr-1 gene
              in E coli strain SHP45 was identified by whole plasmid sequencing
              and subcloning. MCR-1 mechanistic studies were done with sequence
              comparisons, homology modelling, and electrospray ionisation mass
              spectrometry. The prevalence of mcr-1 was investigated in E coli
              and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected from five provinces
              between April, 2011, and November, 2014. The ability of MCR-1 to
              confer polymyxin resistance in vivo was examined in a murine
              thigh model. FINDINGS: Polymyxin resistance was shown to be
              singularly due to the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene. The plasmid
              carrying mcr-1 was mobilised to an E coli recipient at a
              frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-3) cells per recipient cell by
              conjugation, and maintained in K pneumoniae and Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa. In an in-vivo model, production of MCR-1 negated the
              efficacy of colistin. MCR-1 is a member of the
              phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in
              E coli resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid
              A. We observed mcr-1 carriage in E coli isolates collected from
              78 (15\%) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21\%) of 804
              animals during 2011-14, and 16 (1\%) of 1322 samples from
              inpatients with infection. INTERPRETATION: The emergence of MCR-1
              heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, polymyxins,
              by plasmid-mediated resistance. Although currently confined to
              China, MCR-1 is likely to emulate other global resistance
              mechanisms such as NDM-1. Our findings emphasise the urgent need
              for coordinated global action in the fight against
              pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. FUNDING: Ministry of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Traditional methods for molecular epidemiology of
              Neisseria gonorrhoeae are suboptimal. Whole-genome sequencing
              (WGS) offers ideal resolution to describe population dynamics and
              to predict and infer transmission of antimicrobial resistance,
              and can enhance infection control through linkage with
              epidemiological data. We used WGS, in conjunction with linked
              epidemiological and phenotypic data, to describe the gonococcal
              population in 20 European countries. We aimed to detail changes
              in phenotypic antimicrobial resistance levels (and the reasons
              for these changes) and strain distribution (with a focus on
              antimicrobial resistance strains in risk groups), and to predict
              antimicrobial resistance from WGS data. METHODS: We carried out
              an observational study, in which we sequenced isolates taken from
              patients with gonorrhoea from the European Gonococcal
              Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme in 20 countries from
              September to November, 2013. We also developed a web platform
              that we used for automated antimicrobial resistance prediction,
              molecular typing (N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing
              [NG-MAST] and multilocus sequence typing), and phylogenetic
              clustering in conjunction with epidemiological and phenotypic
              data. FINDINGS: The multidrug-resistant NG-MAST genogroup G1407
              was predominant and accounted for the most cephalosporin
              resistance, but the prevalence of this genogroup decreased from
              248 (23\%) of 1066 isolates in a previous study from 2009-10 to
              174 (17\%) of 1054 isolates in this survey in 2013. This
              genogroup previously showed an association with men who have sex
              with men, but changed to an association with heterosexual people
              (odds ratio=4·29). WGS provided substantially improved resolution
              and accuracy over NG-MAST and multilocus sequence typing,
              predicted antimicrobial resistance relatively well, and
              identified discrepant isolates, mixed infections or contaminants,
              and multidrug-resistant clades linked to risk groups.
              INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, we provide the first use of
              joint analysis of WGS and epidemiological data in an
              international programme for regional surveillance of sexually
              transmitted infections. WGS provided enhanced understanding of
              the distribution of antimicrobial resistance clones, including
              replacement with clones that were more susceptible to
              antimicrobials, in several risk groups nationally and regionally.
              We provide a framework for genomic surveillance of gonococci
              through standardised sampling, use of WGS, and a shared

              culture results. This study investigates duration of CRE carriage
              to define populations requiring precautions upon readmission.
              METHODS: Patients with CRE-positive culture during 2009-2010 were
              followed up by rectal swab cultures taken retrospectively and
              prospectively for the study or as part of clinical follow-up.
              RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients met the inclusion
              criteria, with follow-up cultures obtained from 97. Mean time to
              CRE negativity was 387 days (95\% confidence interval: 312-463).
              Seventy-eight percent of patients (64/82) had positive culture at
              3 months, 65\% (38/58) at 6 months, and 39\% (12/30) at 1 year.
              Duration of carriage was affected by repeat hospitalization (P =
              .001) and clinical, as opposed to surveillance, culture (P =
              .002). CONCLUSION: CRE carriers from a previous hospitalization
              have a lower probability of CRE carriage upon readmission if the
              index specimen was a surveillance culture and 1 year passed
              without further hospitalization. Multiple hospitalizations and

              Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2-producing K pneumoniae
              (KPC-2-KP) is almost unknown. METHODS: After a large,
              single-center outbreak of KPC-2-KP, we analyzed carrier
              prevalence through retrospective and prospective investigation of
              intestinal KPC-2-KP carriage 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year,
              and 2 years after acquisition, defined as the earliest date of
              KPC-2-KP detection. Rectal swabs or stool samples were collected
              at baseline and at each visit and submitted for both culture and
              KPC-specific polymerase chain reaction. Resolution of intestinal
              KPC-2-KP carriage was defined as a minimum of 3 consecutive
              negative polymerase chain reaction test results separated by at
              least 48 hours. RESULTS: In patients available for long-term
              evaluation 26 out of 84 patients (31\%) tested negative for
              KPC-2-KP after 1 month, 14 out of 34 (41\%) after 3 months, 17
              out of 26 (65\%) after 6 months, 14 out of 19 (74\%) after 1
              year, and 5 out of 6 (83\%) after 2 years. Decolonization of
              KPC-2-KP was hampered in patients with prolonged or repeated
              hospitalization (P = .044-.140, depending on the time interval).
              Two patients retested positive for KPC-2-KP after they had
              previously shown 3 consecutive negative tests. The longest
              positive KPC-2-KP carrier status so far was observed after nearly
              40 months (1,191 days). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients
              experienced spontaneous decolonization within 6 months after
              acquisition, mainly after discharge from the hospital. However,
              long-term carriage of >3 years is possible. Appropriate infection
              control measures must be taken when these patients are readmitted
              to health care facilities. A series of at least 4 consecutive
              negative rectal swabs or stool samples separated by sufficient
              time intervals appears necessary before the declaration of
              successful KPC-2-KP decolonization is made.",

              Hospital experienced the largest outbreak of a Klebsiella
              pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2)-producing Klebsiella
              pneumoniae (KPC-2-Kp) strain observed in Germany to date. After
              termination of the outbreak, we aimed to reconstruct transmission
              pathways by phylogenetics based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
              METHODS: One hundred seventeen KPC-2-Kp isolates from 89 outbreak
              patients, 5 environmental KPC-2-Kp isolates, and 24 K pneumoniae
              strains not linked to the outbreak underwent WGS. Phylogenetic
              analysis was performed blinded to clinical data and based on the
              genomic reads. RESULTS: A patient from Greece was confirmed as
              the source of the outbreak. Transmission pathways for 11 out of
              89 patients (12.4\%) were plausibly explained by descriptive
              epidemiology, applying strict definitions. Five of these and an
              additional 15 (ie, 20 out of 89 patients [22.5\%]) were confirmed
              by phylogenetics. The rate of phylogenetically confirmed
              transmissions increased significantly from 8 out of 66 (12.1\%
              for the time period before) to 12 out of 23 patients (52.2\% for
              the time period after; P <.001) after implementation of
              systematic screening for KPC-2-Kp (33,623 screening
              investigations within 11 months). Using descriptive epidemiology,
              systematic screening showed no significant effect (7 out of 66
              [10.6\%] vs 4 out of 23 [17.4\%] patients; P = .465). The
              phylogenetic analysis supported the assumption that a
              contaminated positioning pillow served as a reservoir for the
              persistence of KPC-2-Kp. CONCLUSIONS: Effective phylogenetic
              identification of transmissions requires systematic microbiologic
              screening. Extensive screening and phylogenetic analysis based on
              WGS should be started as soon as possible in a bacterial outbreak

  title     = "Present and future arboviral threats",
  author    = "Weaver, Scott C and Reisen, William K",
  abstract  = "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are important causes of
               human disease nearly worldwide. All arboviruses circulate among
               wild animals, and many cause disease after spillover
               transmission to humans and agriculturally important domestic
               animals that are incidental or dead-end hosts. Viruses such as
               dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) that have lost the
               requirement for enzootic amplification now produce extensive
               epidemics in tropical urban centers. Many arboviruses recently
               have increased in importance as human and veterinary pathogens
               using a variety of mechanisms. Beginning in 1999, West Nile
               virus (WNV) underwent a dramatic geographic expansion into the
               Americas. High amplification associated with avian virulence
               coupled with adaptation for replication at higher temperatures
               in mosquito vectors, has caused the largest epidemic of
               arboviral encephalitis ever reported in the Americas. Japanese
               encephalitis virus (JEV), the most frequent arboviral cause of
               encephalitis worldwide, has spread throughout most of Asia and
               as far south as Australia from its putative origin in Indonesia
               and Malaysia. JEV has caused major epidemics as it invaded new
               areas, often enabled by rice culture and amplification in
               domesticated swine. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), another
               arbovirus that infects humans after amplification in
               domesticated animals, undergoes epizootic transmission during
               wet years following droughts. Warming of the Indian Ocean,
               linked to the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation in the Pacific,
               leads to heavy rainfall in east Africa inundating surface pools
               and vertically infected mosquito eggs laid during previous
               seasons. Like WNV, JEV and RVFV could become epizootic and
               epidemic in the Americas if introduced unintentionally via
               commerce or intentionally for nefarious purposes. Climate
               warming also could facilitate the expansion of the distributions
               of many arboviruses, as documented for bluetongue viruses (BTV),
               major pathogens of ruminants. BTV, especially BTV-8, invaded
               Europe after climate warming and enabled the major midge vector
               to expand is distribution northward into southern Europe,
               extending the transmission season and vectorial capacity of
               local midge species. Perhaps the greatest health risk of
               arboviral emergence comes from extensive tropical urbanization
               and the colonization of this expanding habitat by the highly
               anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
               These factors led to the emergence of permanent endemic cycles
               of urban DENV and CHIKV, as well as seasonal interhuman
               transmission of yellow fever virus. The recent invasion into the
               Americas, Europe and Africa by Aedes albopictus, an important
               CHIKV and secondary DENV vector, could enhance urban
               transmission of these viruses in tropical as well as temperate
               regions. The minimal requirements for sustained endemic
               arbovirus transmission, adequate human viremia and vector
               competence of Ae. aegypti and/or Ae. albopictus, may be met by
               two other viruses with the potential to become major human
               pathogens: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, already an
               important cause of neurological disease in humans and equids
               throughout the Americas, and Mayaro virus, a close relative of
               CHIKV that produces a comparably debilitating arthralgic disease
               in South America. Further research is needed to understand the
               potential of these and other arboviruses to emerge in the
               future, invade new geographic areas, and become important public
               and veterinary health problems.",

              reminds us of how little is known about biosafety level 4
              viruses. Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause
              hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a
              genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and
              rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 EVD
              epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV
              infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We
              elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that
              this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome
              abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational
              efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that

              suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve
              as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics.

              attenuation was achieved by recoding of viral proteins using
              underrepresented codon pairs. Because viruses replicate
              exclusively inside living cells, we posited that their codon pair

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly
              being used in clinical microbiology. Like every new technology
              adopted in microbiology, the integration of NGS into clinical and
              routine workflows must be carefully managed. AIM: To review the
              practical aspects of implementing bacterial whole genome
              sequencing (WGS) in routine diagnostic laboratories. SOURCES:
              Review of the literature and expert opinion. CONTENT: In this
              review, we discuss when and how to integrate whole genome
              sequencing (WGS) in the routine workflow of the clinical
              laboratory. In addition, as the microbiology laboratories have to
              adhere to various national and international regulations and
              criteria for their accreditation, we deliberate on quality
              control issues for using WGS in microbiology, including the
              importance of proficiency testing. Furthermore, the current and
              future place of this technology in the diagnostic hierarchy of
              microbiology is described as well as the necessity of maintaining
              backwards compatibility with already established methods.
              Finally, we speculate on the question of whether WGS can entirely
              replace routine microbiology in the future and the tension
              between the fact that most sequencers are designed to process
              multiple samples in parallel whereas for optimal diagnosis a
              one-by-one processing of the samples is preferred. Special
              reference is made to the cost and turnaround time of WGS in
              diagnostic laboratories. IMPLICATIONS: Further development is
              required to improve the workflow for WGS, in particular to
              shorten the turnaround time, reduce costs, and streamline
              downstream data analyses. Only when these processes reach
              maturity will reliance on WGS for routine patient management and
              infection control management become feasible, enabling the

              manner. The field of microbial bioinformatics is thriving and
              quickly adapting to technological changes, which creates
              difficulties for nonbioinformaticians in following the complexity

              is directed towards nonbioinformaticians who wish to gain
              understanding of the overall microbial bioinformatic processes,
              from raw data obtained from sequencers to final outputs. SOURCES:
              The software and analytical strategies reviewed are based on the
              personal experience of the authors. CONTENT: The bioinformatic
              processes of transforming raw reads to actionable information in
              a clinical and epidemiologic context is explained. We review the
              advantages and limitations of two major strategies currently
              applied: read mapping, which is the comparison with a predefined
              reference genome, and de novo assembly, which is the unguided
              assembly of the raw data. Finally, we discuss the main analytical
              methodologies and the most frequently used freely available
              software and its application in the context of bacterial
              infectious disease management. IMPLICATIONS: High-throughput

              the genetic diversity of bat hepadnaviruses exceeds that of

              (22.5\%) on meningitis, 7 (5.8\%) on diarrhoea and 5 (4.2\%) on
              pneumonia. Children comprised the majority of subjects. Studies
              of UTI reported moderate to high rates of AMR to commonly used
              antibiotics including evidence of the emergence of cephalosporin
              resistance. We found moderate rates of AMR among common
              bloodstream pathogens to typical first-line antibiotics including
              ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and
              amoxicillin/clavulanate. Among S. pneumoniae strains isolated in
              patients with meningitis, levels of penicillin resistance were
              low to moderate with no significant resistance noted to
              ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. AMR was common in this region,
              particularly in hospitalized patients with BSI and both
              outpatient and hospitalized patients with UTI. This raises
              concern given the limited diagnostic capability and second-line
              treatment options in the public sector in West Africa.",

  author   = "Muzzi, Alessandro and Donati, Claudio",
  abstract = "The genetic variability in bacterial species is much larger than
              in other kingdoms of life. The gene content between pairs of
              isolates can diverge by as much as 30\% in species like
              Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae. This unexpected
              finding led to the introduction of the concept of the pan-genome,
              the set of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species.
              The genome of any isolate is thus composed by a ``core genome''
              shared by all strains and characteristic of the species, and a
              ``dispensable genome'' that accounts for many of the phenotypic
              differences between strains. The pan-genome is usually much
              larger than the genome of any single isolate and, given the
              ability of many bacteria to exchange genetic material with the
              environment, constitutes a reservoir that could enhance their
              ability to survive in a mutating environment. To understand the
              evolution of the pan-genome of an important pathogen and its
              interactions with the commensal microbial flora, we have analyzed
              the genomes of 44 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the
              most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. Despite
              evidence of extensive homologous recombination, the S. pneumoniae
              phylogenetic tree reconstructed from polymorphisms in the core
              genome identified major groups of genetically related strains.
              With the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with
              capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease
              outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes was consistent
              with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events
              attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages.
              Homologous recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was
              the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S.
              pneumoniae. Genetic exchange with related species sharing the
              same ecological niche was the main mechanism of evolution of S.
              pneumonia; and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic
              diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome of S. pneumoniae
              increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly
              with the variability of the sample, suggesting that acquired
              genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones.",

              participants revealed an ESBL-PE prevalence rate of 6.8\%
              (14/205). Among 191 participants that were ESBL-negative before
              travel, 58 (30.4\%) were colonized by ESBL-producing Escherichia
              coli, and 5 (8.6\%) additionally carried ESBL-producing
              Klebsiella pneumoniae upon return. However, no
              carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected.
              ESBL-genotyping revealed that 52/54 (96.6\%) E. coli and 4/4
              (100\%) K. pneumoniae strains available for sequencing produced
              CTX-M enzymes, mostly CTX-M-15 (33/56, 58.9\%), and 2/54 (3.7\%)
              E. coli strains produced SHV-12 enzymes. Travel to India was
              associated with the highest ESBL-PE acquisition rate (11/15,
              73.3\%; p=0.015), followed by South East Asia (22/46, 47.8\%;
              p=0.038). Evaluation of travel-associated risk factors

              carbapenemase (KPC)-2-producing K. pneumoniae are an increasing

              investigate the impact of clinical infection on mortality, and
              examine the effect of use of KPC-2-specific polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR) on the time to contact isolation during an
              outbreak. METHODS: Cases were defined as patients clinically
              infected or colonized with KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae between
              June 2010 and July 2012. Cases were described by demographic and
              health characteristics, and the association between infection and
              mortality, adjusted for comorbidities and demographic
              characteristics, was determined using Poisson regression with
              robust standard errors. A comparison was made between the time to
              contact isolation with a culture-based method and PCR using
              Wilcoxon's rank sum test. FINDINGS: Of 72 cases detected, 17
              (24\%) had undergone transplantation and 21 (29\%) had a
              malignancy. Overall, 35 (49\%) cases were clinically infected,
              with pneumonia and sepsis being the most common infections.
              Infection was an independent risk factor for mortality (risk
              ratio 1.67, 95\% confidence interval 0.99-2.82). The median time
              to contact isolation was 1.5 days (range 0-21 days) using PCR and
              5.0 days (range 0-39 days) using culture-based methods (P =
              0.003). Intermittent negative tests were observed in 48\% (14/29)
              of cases tested using culture-based methods. CONCLUSION:
              KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae mainly affect severely ill
              patients. Half of the cases developed clinical infection,
              associated with increased risk of death. As PCR accelerates
              isolation and provides the opportunity for preventive measures in
              colonized cases, its use should be implemented promptly during
              outbreaks. Further studies are needed to enhance knowledge about
              KPC detection patterns and to adjust screening guidelines.",

              high-throughput sequencing has become more commonplace. The
              preparation of a sample is known to have an effect on the
              representation of virus sequences within the metagenomic dataset
              yet comparatively little attention has been given to this.
              Physical enrichment techniques are often applied to samples to
              increase the number of viral sequences and therefore enhance the
              probability of detection. With the exception of virus ecology
              studies, there is a paucity of information available to
              researchers on the type of sample preparation required for a
              viral metagenomic study that seeks to identify an aetiological
              virus in an animal or human diagnostic sample. A review of
              published virus discovery studies revealed the most commonly used
              enrichment methods, that were usually quick and simple to
              implement, namely low-speed centrifugation, filtration,
              nuclease-treatment (or combinations of these) which have been
              routinely used but often without justification. These were
              applied to a simple and well-characterised artificial sample
              composed of bacterial and human cells, as well as DNA
              (adenovirus) and RNA viruses (influenza A and human enterovirus),
              being either non-enveloped capsid or enveloped viruses. The
              effect of the enrichment method was assessed by both quantitative
              real-time PCR and metagenomic analysis that incorporated an
              amplification step. Reductions in the absolute quantities of
              bacteria and human cells were observed for each method as
              determined by qPCR, but the relative abundance of viral sequences
              in the metagenomic dataset remained largely unchanged. A 3-step
              method of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease-treatment
              showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral
              sequences. This study provides a starting point for the selection
              of a purification method in future virus discovery studies, and
              highlights the need for more data to validate the effect of
              enrichment methods on different sample types, amplification,
              bioinformatics approaches and sequencing platforms. This study
              also highlights the potential risks that may attend selection of
              a virus enrichment method without any consideration for the
              sample type being investigated.",

              this study, different variables of the laboratory methods often

              their abilities to detect multiple viruses and generate full
              genome coverage. A biological reagent consisting of 25 different
              human RNA and DNA viral pathogens was used to estimate the effect
              of filtration and nuclease digestion, DNA/RNA extraction methods,

              kits on the detection of viral nucleic acids. Filtration and

              viral sequence reads and number of viruses detected. For nucleic
              acid extractions silica spin columns improved viral sequence

              fraction of their genomes than the TruSeq and Nextera methods.

              up to 22 different viruses in the biological reagent analyzed

              However, the process is an unpredictable event, making it
              difficult to predict the emergence of a new pandemic virus and
              distinguish its origin, especially when the virus is the result
              of multiple infections. Therefore, identifying a novel influenza
              is entirely dependent on sequencing its whole genome.
              Occasionally, however, it can be time-consuming, costly, and
              labor-intensive when sequencing many influenza viruses. To
              compensate for the difficulty, we developed a rapid,

              genomic segments. As an example to evaluate its performance, H3N8

              primer specificity. As a result, 16 primer pairs were selected to

              eight sets composing of four segment combinations using viral

              that the multiplex RT-PCR has a wide range of applications in

  abstract = "A review of the literature on the mutagenicity/genotoxicity of
              surface waters is presented in this article. Subheadings of this
              article include a description of sample concentration methods,
              mutagenic/genotoxic bioassay data, and suspected or identified
              mutagens in surface waters published in the literature since
              1990. Much of the published surface water
              mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies employed the
              Salmonella/mutagenicity test with strains TA98 and/or TA100 with
              and/or without metabolic activation. Among all data analyzed, the
              percentage of positive samples toward TA98 was approximately
              15\%, both in the absence and the presence of S9 mix. Those
              positive toward TA100 were 7\%, both with and without S9 mix. The
              percentage classified as highly mutagenic (2500-5000 revertants
              per liter) or extremely mutagenic (more than 5000 revertants per
              liter) was approximately 3-5\% both towards TA98 and TA100,
              regardless of the absence or the presence of S9 mix. This
              analysis demonstrates that some rivers in the world, especially
              in Europe, Asia and South America, are contaminated with potent
              direct-acting and indirect-acting frameshift-type and base
              substitution-type mutagens. These rivers are reported to be
              contaminated by either partially treated or untreated discharges
              from chemical industries, petrochemical industries, oil
              refineries, oil spills, rolling steel mills, untreated domestic
              sludges and pesticides runoff. Aquatic organisms such as teleosts
              and bivalves have also been used as sentinels to monitor
              contamination of surface water with genotoxic chemicals. DNA
              modifications were analyzed for this purpose. Many studies
              indicate that the 32P-postlabeling assay, the single cell gel
              electrophoresis (comet) assay and the micronucleus test are
              sensitive enough to monitor genotoxic responses of indigenous
              aquatic organisms to environmental pollution. In order to
              efficiently assess the presence of mutagens in the water, in
              addition to the chemical analysis, mutagenicity/genotoxicity
              assays should be included as additional parameters in water
              quality monitoring programs. This is because according to this
              review they proved to be sensitive and reliable tools in the
              detection of mutagenic activity in aquatic environment. Many
              attempts to identify the chemicals responsible for the
              mutagenicity/genotoxicity of surface waters have been reported.
              Among these reports, researchers identified heavy metals, PAHs,
              heterocyclic amines, pesticides and so on. By combining the blue
              cotton hanging method as an adsorbent and the
              O-acetyltransferase-overproducing strain as a sensitive strain
              for aminoarenes, Japanese researchers identified two new type of
              potent frameshift-type mutagens, formed unintentionally, in
              several surface waters. One group has a 2-phenylbenzotriazole
              (PBTA) structure, and seven analogues, PBTA-type mutagens, were
              identified in surface waters collected at sites below textile
              dyeing factories and municipal wastewater treatment plants
              treating domestic wastes and effluents. The other one has a
              polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) skelton with nitro and amino
              substitution group and it was revealed to be
              4-amino-3,3'-dichloro-5,4'-dinitrobiphenyl derived from chemical
              plants treating polymers and dye intermediates. However, the
              identification of major putative mutagenic/genotoxic compounds in
              most surface waters with high mutagenic/genotoxic activity in the
              world have not been performed. Further efforts on chemical
              isolation and identification by bioassay-directed chemical
              analysis should be performed.",

              indicating the existence of other potential new and unknown
              tick-borne viruses. We used high-throughput sequencing to analyse
              the virome of Ixodes ricinus, the main vector of tick-borne
              pathogens in Europe. The majority of collected viral sequences
              were assigned to two potentially novel Nairovirus and Phlebovirus
              viruses, with prevalence rates ranging from 3.95\% to 23.88\% in

              studied. Eyach virus prevalence varied between 0.07\% and 5.26\%

              was successfully isolated following intracerebral inoculation of

              level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity
              needed in their laboratories. First, a laboratory sample rotator
              is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as
              well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by
              mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between.
              Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no
              tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily
              transported to operate in various locations in a lab including
              desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove
              boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board
              Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the
              functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be
              customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can
              simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code
              to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample
              rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and
              adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more.
              Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the
              proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while
              saving over 90\% of the costs.",

              Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was evaluated as a means for
              rapid classification and identification of Pantoea strains. Four
              housekeeping genes, gyrB, rpoB, atpD and infB, were sequenced for
              strains assigned to the genus. Included in the study were (1)
              reference strains from the seven currently recognized species of
              Pantoea, (2) strains belonging to Brenner DNA groups II, IV and
              V, previously isolated from clinical samples and difficult to
              identify because of high phenotypic similarity to P. agglomerans
              or P. ananatis and (3) isolates from diseased Eucalyptus, maize
              and onion, assigned to the genus on the basis of phenotypic
              tests. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the sequences of
              the four housekeeping genes. The ``core''Pantoea species formed a
              cluster separate from the ``Japanese'' species which formed a
              tight cluster that included the genus Tatumella when the tree was
              based on concatenated sequences of the four genes. The MLSA data
              further suggested the existence of ten potential novel species,

              species and the possible inclusion of Pectobacterium cypripedii

              Classification of strains is difficult owing to its polyphyletic
              nature, based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. It has been previously
              acknowledged that Enterobacter contains species which should be
              transferred to other genera. In an attempt to resolve the
              taxonomy of Enterobacter, MLSA based on partial sequencing of

              fatty acid profiles, enabling differentiation of the MLSA groups.

              virus (LCMV) with a codon deoptimized (CD) surface glycoprotein

              in cultured cells despite barely detectable GP expression levels
              in rLCMV/CD-infected cells. Importantly, rLCMV/CD was highly
              attenuated in vivo but able to induce complete protection against
              a subsequent lethal challenge with rLCMV/WT. Our findings support
              the feasibility of implementing an arenavirus GP CD-based
              approach for the development of safe and effective

              SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, can cause severe illness and death.
              Investigations over the past 35 years have illuminated many
              aspects of coronavirus replication. The focus of this review is
              the functional analysis of conserved RNA secondary structures in
              the 5' and 3' of the betacoronavirus genomes. The 5' 350
              nucleotides folds into a set of RNA secondary structures which
              are well conserved, and reverse genetic studies indicate that
              these structures play an important role in the discontinuous
              synthesis of subgenomic RNAs in the betacoronaviruses. These
              cis-acting elements extend 3' of the 5'UTR into ORF1a. The 3'UTR
              is similarly conserved and contains all of the cis-acting
              sequences necessary for viral replication. Two competing
              conformations near the 5' end of the 3'UTR have been shown to
              make up a potential molecular switch. There is some evidence that
              an association between the 3' and 5'UTRs is necessary for
              subgenomic RNA synthesis, but the basis for this association is
              not yet clear. A number of host RNA proteins have been shown to
              bind to the 5' and 3' cis-acting regions, but the significance of
              these in viral replication is not clear. Two viral proteins have
              been identified as binding to the 5' cis-acting region, nsp1 and
              N protein. A genetic interaction between nsp8 and nsp9 and the
              region of the 3'UTR that contains the putative molecular switch
              suggests that these two proteins bind to this region.",

              Wastewater releases from New Delhi hospitals may pose a greater

              introduce Mol2vec, which is an unsupervised machine learning
              approach to learn vector representations of molecular
              substructures. Like the Word2vec models, where vectors of closely
              related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec
              learns vector representations of molecular substructures that
              point in similar directions for chemically related substructures.
              Compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing the
              vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed
              into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound
              properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are
              obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on
              a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available
              chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once,
              yields dense vector representations, and overcomes drawbacks of
              common compound feature representations such as sparseness and
              bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on

              Although these ambitious targets are feasible biochemically,
              comparable technologies for the chemical synthesis of long DNA
              strands lag far behind. The best available chemical approach is
              the solid-phase phosphoramidite method, which can be used to
              assemble DNA strands up to 150 bases in length. Beyond this
              point, deficiencies in the chemistry make it impossible to
              produce pure DNA. A possible alternative approach to the chemical
              synthesis of large DNA strands is to join together carefully
              purified synthetic oligonucleotides by chemical methods. Click
              ligation by the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne (CuAAC) reaction
              could facilitate this process. In this Account, we describe the
              synthesis, characterization, and applications of oligonucleotides
              prepared by click ligation. The alkyne and azide oligonucleotide
              strands can be prepared by standard protocols, and the ligation
              reaction is compatible with a wide range of chemical
              modifications to DNA and RNA. We have employed click ligation to
              synthesize DNA constructs up to 300 bases in length and much
              longer sequences are feasible. When the resulting triazole
              linkage is placed in a PCR template, various DNA polymerases
              correctly copy the entire base sequence. We have also
              successfully demonstrated both in vitro transcription and rolling
              circle amplification through the modified linkage. This linkage
              has shown in vivo biocompatibility: an antibiotic resistance gene
              containing triazole linkages functions in E. coli . Using click
              ligation, we have synthesized hairpin ribozymes up to 100
              nucleotides in length and a hammerhead ribozyme with the triazole
              linkage located at the substrate cleavage site. At the opposite
              end of the length scale, click-ligated, cyclic mini-DNA duplexes
              have been used as models to study base pairing. Cyclic duplexes

               Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it
               receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages
               in May/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we
               quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG), and
               coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from
               seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges
               and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1
               levels and water quality conditions between season and region.
               Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all
               sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water
               (5.4 $\pm$ 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL--1); 95\% confidence interval)
               and sediment (6.3 $\pm$ 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg--1)) samples from
               both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were
               very low across all sites in the Upper Ganges in February (2.1
               $\pm$ 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL--1)), and water quality was good
               (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1
               levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column
               relative to February, and blaNDM-1 levels significantly
               correlated with fecal coliform levels (r = 0.61; p = 0.007).
               Given that waste management infrastructure is limited in
               Rishikesh-Haridwar, data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in
               visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in
               seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas
               without adequate waste treatment are possible ``hot spots'' for
               AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce
               broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.",

              disease. However, reducing the amount of energy used in treatment
              processes has become essential for the future. One low-energy
              treatment option is anaerobic-aerobic sequence (AAS) bioreactors,
              which use an anaerobic pretreatment step (e.g., anaerobic hybrid
              reactors) to reduce carbon levels, followed by some form of
              aerobic treatment. Although AAS is common in warm climates, it is
              not known how its compares to other treatment options relative to
              disease transmission, including its influence on antibiotic
              resistance (AR) in treated effluents. Here, we used metagenomic
              approaches to contrast the fate of antibiotic-resistant genes
              (ARG) in anaerobic, aerobic, and AAS bioreactors treating
              domestic wastewater. Five reactor configurations were monitored
              for 6 months, and treatment performance, energy use, and ARG
              abundance and diversity were compared in influents and effluents.
              AAS and aerobic reactors were superior to anaerobic units in
              reducing ARG-like sequence abundances, with effluent ARG levels
              of 29, 34, and 74 ppm (198 ppm influent), respectively. AAS and
              aerobic systems especially reduced aminoglycoside, tetracycline,
              and $\beta$-lactam ARG levels relative to anaerobic units,
              although 63 persistent ARG subtypes were detected in effluents
              from all systems (of 234 assessed). Sulfonamide and
              chloramphenicol ARG levels were largely unaffected by treatment,
              whereas a broad shift from target-specific ARGs to ARGs
              associated with multi-drug resistance was seen across influents
              and effluents. AAS reactors show promise for future applications
              because they can reduce more ARGs for less energy (32\% less
              energy here), but all three treatment options have limitations

               in benign and pathogenic bacteria, posing an emerging threat to
               public and environmental health in the future. Although evidence
               has existed for years from clinical data of increasing AR,
               almost no quantitative environmental data exist that span
               increased industrial antibiotic production in the 1950s to the
               present; i.e., data that might delineate trends in AR
               potentially valuable for epidemiological studies. To address
               this critical knowledge gap, we speculated that AR levels might
               be apparent in historic soil archives as evidenced by antibiotic
               resistance gene (ARG) abundances over time. Accordingly, DNA was
               extracted from five long-term soil-series from different

               classes were quantified. Results show that ARG from all classes
               of antibiotics tested have significantly increased since 1940,
               but especially within the tetracyclines, with some individual
               ARG being >15 times more abundant now than in the 1970s. This is
               noteworthy because waste management procedures have broadly
               improved and stricter rules on nontherapeutic antibiotic use in
               agriculture are being promulgated. Although these data are local
               to The Netherlands, they suggest basal environmental levels of

              group? more or less synonymously, these two concepts bear
              different meanings. The guild concept refers primarily to the
              mechanisms of resource sharing by species in a competitive
              context whereas the functional groups concept is concerned with
              how a resource or any other ecological component is processed by
              different species to provide a specific ecosystem service or
              function. In many cases but not necessarily all, the two concepts
              are the two ?faces? or ?sides? of the same coin: the sharing by
              species of a similar resource is the guild facet (structural),
              while the ecosystem processes these species eventually perform
              through resource exploitation is the functional group facet. The
              two concepts differ in that competitive relationships within
              groups of species are not the focus of the functional group
              approach, exactly as processes or functions are not the focus of
              the guild approach. A group of species can be considered either
              as a guild or a functional group depending on the question
              addressed. Guild and functional group membership is independent
              of phylogenetic relationships but because species tend to share
              similar life history traits and adaptations through common
              evolutionary history, guild and functional group associates are
              often closely related. The concept of guild has had broader
              application in animal studies than in plant studies, whereas the
              reverse is true for the concept of functional group. Recent
              methodological advances to objectively partition species into
              guilds and functional groups, taking into consideration the most
              relevant characters or traits for delineating them, provide the
              means to construct an operational framework for making in situ
              and ex situ experiments that are urgently needed for a better
              understanding of the role of species in ecosystem functioning,

              inconsistencies and more representative of whole-genomes than are
              single-gene trees. Here, we present a distance-based phylogeny
              constructed on the basis of gene content, rather than on sequence
              identity, of 13 completely sequenced genomes of unicellular
              species. The similarity between two species is defined as the
              number of genes that they have in common divided by their total
              number of genes. In this type of phylogenetic analysis,
              evolutionary distance can be interpreted in terms of evolutionary
              events such as the acquisition and loss of genes, whereas the
              underlying properties (the gene content) can be interpreted in
              terms of function. As such, it takes a position intermediate to
              phylogenies based on single genes and phylogenies based on

              phylogeny is independent of phylogenies based on the level of
              sequence identity of individual genes, it correlates with the
              standard reference of prokarytic phylogeny based on sequence

              affect the physiology of individual cells and ultimately have the
              potential to shape the biogeochemistry of the Earth. For example,
              the growth of Prochlorococcus, the numerically dominant
              cyanobacterium in the oceans, can be improved by the activity of
              co-occurring heterotrophs. This effect has been largely
              attributed to the role of heterotrophs in detoxifying reactive
              oxygen species that Prochlorococcus, which lacks catalase,
              cannot. Here, we explore this phenomenon further by examining how
              the entire transcriptome of Prochlorococcus NATL2A changes in the
              presence of a naturally co-occurring heterotroph, Alteromonas
              macleodii MIT1002, with which it was co-cultured for years,
              separated and then reunited. Significant changes in the
              Prochlorococcus transcriptome were evident within 6 h of
              initiating co-culture, with groups of transcripts changing in
              different temporal waves. Many transcriptional changes persisted
              throughout the 48 h experiment, suggesting that the presence of
              the heterotroph affected a stable shift in Prochlorococcus
              physiology. These initial transcriptome changes largely
              corresponded to reduced stress conditions for Prochlorococcus, as
              inferred from the depletion of transcripts encoding DNA repair
              enzymes and many members of the 'high light inducible' family of
              stress-response proteins. Later, notable changes were seen in

              (particularly, an increase in PSI subunits and chlorophyll
              synthesis enzymes), ribosomal proteins and biosynthetic enzymes,
              suggesting that the introduction of the heterotroph may have
              induced increased production of reduced carbon compounds for
              export. Changes in secretion-related proteins and transporters

              be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological
              factors, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these
              linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of
              EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of
              EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global
              patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after
              controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the
              1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are
              dominated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these
              (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute
              respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly
              over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by
              bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of
              drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that
              EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic,
              environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for
              identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate
              (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial
              risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at

              the paucity of alimentary enzymes encoded by the human genome,
              our ability to derive energy from dietary fibre depends on the

              to reconstructing the origins and tracing the flow of IAV within
              and between hosts. Here we show that explicitly allowing IAV host
              lineages to have independent rates of molecular evolution is
              necessary for reliable phylogenetic inference of IAV and that
              methods that do not do so, including 'relaxed' molecular clock
              models, can be positively misleading. A phylogenomic analysis
              using a host-specific local clock model recovers extremely
              consistent evolutionary histories across all genomic segments and
              demonstrates that the equine H7N7 lineage is a sister clade to
              strains from birds--as well as those from humans, swine and the
              equine H3N8 lineage--sharing an ancestor with them in the mid to

              these key nodes, we infer that the internal genes of avian
              influenza virus (AIV) underwent a global selective sweep
              beginning in the late 1800s, a process that continued throughout
              the twentieth century and up to the present. The resulting

              largely unknown. General metagenome functions often correlate
              with the underlying structure of bacterial communities. However,
              ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile, prompting speculation that
              resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or
              ecological divisions. To investigate these relationships, we
              performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18
              antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895
              ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major
              resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate that distinct soil types
              harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen
              fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome
              composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and
              taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types.
              Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes

              transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil

              not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed

              bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of
              soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal

              endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA complementarity to identify target

              In its native context, Cas9 acts on DNA substrates exclusively
              because both binding and catalysis require recognition of a short
              DNA sequence, known as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), next
              to and on the strand opposite the twenty-nucleotide target site
              in dsDNA. Cas9 has proven to be a versatile tool for genome
              engineering and gene regulation in a large range of prokaryotic
              and eukaryotic cell types, and in whole organisms, but it has
              been thought to be incapable of targeting RNA. Here we show that
              Cas9 binds with high affinity to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
              targets matching the Cas9-associated guide RNA sequence when the
              PAM is presented in trans as a separate DNA oligonucleotide.
              Furthermore, PAM-presenting oligonucleotides (PAMmers) stimulate
              site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of ssRNA targets, similar
              to PAM-mediated stimulation of Cas9-catalysed DNA cleavage. Using
              specially designed PAMmers, Cas9 can be specifically directed to
              bind or cut RNA targets while avoiding corresponding DNA

              largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving
              transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern
              native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we

              unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to
              what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood
              production is maintained by the successive recruitment of
              thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature

              characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have
              remained largely unexplored. Here we show that the global
              circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to 2009), B/Victoria, and
              B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of A/H3N2

              Whereas genetic variants of A/H3N2 viruses did not persist

  abstract = "The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on
              record, responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299
              deaths. Genome sequencing in viral outbreaks is desirable to
              characterize the infectious agent and determine its evolutionary
              rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification of
              signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of
              diagnostic targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines
              and treatments. The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate
              in the Makona strain has been estimated at between 0.87 $\times$
              10(-3) and 1.42 $\times$ 10(-3) mutations per site per year. This
              is equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that
              sequences diverge rapidly enough to identify distinct
              sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic. Genome sequencing
              provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is
              increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence
              data may be used to guide control measures, but only if the
              results are generated quickly enough to inform interventions.
              Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic owing
              to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical
              difficulties transporting samples to remote sequencing
              facilities. To address this problem, here we devise a genomic
              surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA sequencing
              instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard
              airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic
              surveillance of the ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data
              and analysis of 142 EBOV samples collected during the period
              March to October 2015. We were able to generate results less than
              24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the
              sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that
              real-time genomic surveillance is possible in resource-limited
              settings and can be established rapidly to monitor outbreaks.",

              However, this cycling is constrained by viruses that affect
              community composition, metabolic activity, and evolutionary

              cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains
              poorly described and grossly understudied, with less than 1\% of
              observed surface-ocean viruses known. Here we assemble complete

              deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina
              research expeditions, and analyse the resulting 'global ocean

              double-stranded DNA viruses complete with genomic and ecological
              contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic viral
              populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters

              both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of

              together accounting for nearly half of the viral populations in

               confirmed in May 2015 in northeast Brazil1. Brazil has had the
               highest number of reported ZIKV cases worldwide (more than
               200,000 by 24 December 20162) and the most cases associated with
               microcephaly and other birth defects (2,366 confirmed by 31
               December 20162). Since the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil,
               more than 45 countries in the Americas have reported local ZIKV
               transmission, with 24 of these reporting severe ZIKV-associated
               disease3. However, the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in
               Brazil and the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the
               value of this information for interpreting observed trends in
               reported microcephaly. Here we address this issue by generating
               54 complete or partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from Brazil, and
               reporting data generated by a mobile genomics laboratory that
               travelled across northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence
               represents the earliest confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil.
               Analyses of viral genomes with ecological and epidemiological
               data yield an estimate that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil
               by February 2014 and is likely to have disseminated from there,
               nationally and internationally, before the first detection of
               ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates for the international
               spread of ZIKV from Brazil indicate the duration of
               pre-detection cryptic transmission in recipient regions. The
               role of northeast Brazil in the establishment of ZIKV in the
               Americas is further supported by geographic analysis of ZIKV
               transmission potential and by estimates of the basic
               reproduction number of the virus.",

              dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes.
              Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
              experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome
              metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals
              through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness
              gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by
              signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the
              experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously
              competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between
              ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as
              long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most
              populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also
              present evidence that the targets of natural selection change
              over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the
              strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results
              show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a

              bottom-up self-assembly of micrometre-scale, three-dimensional
              structures with nanometre-precise features. These structures are
              customizable in that they can be site-specifically functionalized
              or constructed to exhibit machine-like or logic-gating behaviour.
              Their use has been limited to applications that require only
              small amounts of material (of the order of micrograms), owing to
              the limitations of current production methods. But many proposed
              applications, for example as therapeutic agents or in complex
              materials, could be realized if more material could be used. In
              DNA origami, a nanostructure is assembled from a very long
              single-stranded scaffold molecule held in place by many short
              single-stranded staple oligonucleotides. Only the
              bacteriophage-derived scaffold molecules are amenable to scalable
              and efficient mass production; the shorter staple strands are
              obtained through costly solid-phase synthesis or enzymatic
              processes. Here we show that single strands of DNA of virtually
              arbitrary length and with virtually arbitrary sequences can be
              produced in a scalable and cost-efficient manner by using
              bacteriophages to generate single-stranded precursor DNA that
              contains target strand sequences interleaved with self-excising
              'cassettes', with each cassette comprising two Zn2+-dependent
              DNA-cleaving DNA enzymes. We produce all of the necessary single
              strands of DNA for several DNA origami using shaker-flask
              cultures, and demonstrate end-to-end production of macroscopic
              amounts of a DNA origami nanorod in a litre-scale stirred-tank

              of DNA origami objects that are necessary for implementing custom

              enzymes, viruses and subcellular structures often form by
              self-limiting hierarchical oligomerization of multiple subunits.
              Large structures can also assemble efficiently from a few
              components by combining hierarchical assembly and symmetry, a
              strategy exemplified by viral capsids. De novo protein design and
              RNA and DNA nanotechnology aim to mimic these capabilities, but
              the bottom-up construction of artificial structures with the
              dimensions and complexity of viruses and other subcellular
              components remains challenging. Here we show that natural
              assembly principles can be combined with the methods of DNA
              origami to produce gigadalton-scale structures with controlled
              sizes. DNA sequence information is used to encode the shapes of
              individual DNA origami building blocks, and the geometry and
              details of the interactions between these building blocks then
              control their copy numbers, positions and orientations within
              higher-order assemblies. We illustrate this strategy by creating
              planar rings of up to 350 nanometres in diameter and with atomic
              masses of up to 330 megadaltons, micrometre-long, thick tubes
              commensurate in size to some bacilli, and three-dimensional
              polyhedral assemblies with sizes of up to 1.2 gigadaltons and 450
              nanometres in diameter. We achieve efficient assembly, with
              yields of up to 90 per cent, by using building blocks with
              validated structure and sufficient rigidity, and an accurate
              design with interaction motifs that ensure that hierarchical
              assembly is self-limiting and able to proceed in equilibrium to
              allow for error correction. We expect that our method, which
              enables the self-assembly of structures with sizes approaching
              that of viruses and cellular organelles, can readily be used to
              create a range of other complex structures with well defined
              sizes, by exploiting the modularity and high degree of
              addressability of the DNA origami building blocks used.",

              metagenomic studies are performed on increasingly larger scales.
              While recent taxonomic classification programs achieve high speed
              by comparing genomic k-mers, they often lack sensitivity for
              overcoming evolutionary divergence, so that large fractions of

              novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact
              matches on the protein-level using the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
              We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies
              reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with
              current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are
              underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that
              Kaiju classifies up to 10 times more reads in real metagenomes.
              Kaiju can process millions of reads per minute and can run on a

              the full scale of the tree has remained elusive. Recent
              depictions of the tree of life have focused either on the nature

              well-classified diversity of life with an emphasis on
              eukaryotes(6). These approaches overlook the dramatic change in
              our understanding of life's diversity resulting from genomic
              sampling of previously unexamined environments. New methods to
              generate genome sequences illuminate the identity of organisms

              many viral particles are released at cell lysis, or by lysogeny,
              when phages integrate into the host's genome. We recently
              proposed a new dynamic model of bacteria-phage interactions in
              which lysogeny predominates at high microbial abundance and
              growth rates. This model, named Piggyback-the-Winner (PtW),
              contrasts to current accepted models on the frequency of lysis
              and lysogeny and predicts that phages integrate into their hosts'
              genomes as prophages when microbial abundances and growth rates
              are high. According to PtW, switching to the temperate life cycle
              reduces phage predation control on bacterial abundance and
              confers superinfection exclusion, preventing that a
              closely-related phage infects the same bacterial cell. Here we
              examine how PtW is important for metazoans. Specifically, we
              postulate that PtW and the recently described bacteriophage
              adherence to mucus (BAM) model are strongly interrelated and have
              an important role in the development of the microbiome. In BAM,
              phage produced by the microbiome attach to mucins and protect
              underlying epithelial cells from invading bacteria. Spatial
              structuring of the mucus creates a gradient of phage replication
              strategies consistent with PtW. We predict that lysogeny is
              favored at the top mucosal layer and lytic predation predominates
              in the bacteria-sparse intermediary layers. The lysogeny confers
              competitive advantage to commensals against niche invasion and
              the lytic infection eliminates potential pathogens from deeper

              multiplexing ability. We recently introduced Smart-seq for
              transcriptome analysis from single cells, and we subsequently
              optimized the method for improved sensitivity, accuracy and
              full-length coverage across transcripts. Here we present a
              detailed protocol for Smart-seq2 that allows the generation of
              full-length cDNA and sequencing libraries by using standard
              reagents. The entire protocol takes ∼2 d from cell picking to
              having a final library ready for sequencing; sequencing will
              require an additional 1-3 d depending on the strategy and
              sequencer. The current limitations are the lack of strand
              specificity and the inability to detect nonpolyadenylated
              (polyA(-)) RNA.",

              Barcoding of DNA template molecules early in next-generation
              sequencing (NGS) library construction provides a way to identify
              and bioinformatically remove polymerase errors that otherwise
              make detection of these rare variants very difficult. Several
              barcoding strategies have been reported, but all require long and
              complex library preparation protocols. Simple, multiplexed,
              PCR-based barcoding of DNA for sensitive mutation detection using
              sequencing (SiMSen-seq) was developed to generate targeted
              barcoded libraries with minimal DNA input, flexible target
              selection and a very simple, short (∼4 h) library construction

               thiosulfate as an intermediate of this pathway and pointed at a
               heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr)-like system acting as a
               sulfur-oxidizing entity. Indeed, marker exchange mutagenesis of
               hdr-like genes disrupted the ability of H. denitrificans to
               metabolize DMS and also prevented formation of sulfate from
               thiosulfate provided as an additional electron source during
               chemoorganoheterotrophic growth. Complementation with the
               hdr-like genes under a constitutive promoter rescued the
               phenotype on thiosulfate as well as on DMS. The production of
               sulfate from an organosulfur precursor via the Hdr-like system
               is previously undocumented and provides a new shunt in the
               biogeochemical sulfur cycle. Furthermore, our findings fill a
               long-standing knowledge gap in microbial dissimilatory sulfur
               metabolism because the Hdr-like pathway is abundant not only in
               chemoheterotrophs, but also in a wide range of chemo- and

              comparative phylogenomic analysis of 270 recently available MGII
              metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to investigate their
              evolution and ecology. Based on a rank-normalised genome

              which we propose the name Candidatus Poseidoniales (after Gr. n.
              Poseidon, God of the sea), comprising the families Candidatus
              Poseidonaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIa) and Candidatus
              Thalassarchaeaceae fam. nov. (formerly subgroup MGIIb). Within
              these families, 21 genera could be resolved, many of which had
              distinct biogeographic ranges and inferred nutrient preferences.
              Phylogenetic analyses of key metabolic functions suggest that the
              ancestor of Ca. Poseidoniales was a surface water-dwelling
              photoheterotroph that evolved to occupy multiple related
              ecological niches based primarily on spectral tuning of

              involve an overwrite mechanism whereby an existing single copy of
              the proteorhodopsin gene is replaced by a horizontally
              transferred copy, which in many instances should allow an abrupt
              change in light absorption capacity. Phototrophy was lost

              co-cultures of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 isolates representing
              both high- and low-light adapted clades. We examined: (1) the
              influence of Prochlorococcus on the growth of SAR11 and
              vice-versa, (2) whether Prochlorococcus can meet specific
              nutrient requirements of SAR11, and (3) how co-culture dynamics
              vary when Prochlorococcus is grown with SAR11 compared with
              sympatric copiotrophic bacteria. SAR11 grew 15-70\% faster in
              co-culture with Prochlorococcus, while the growth of the latter
              was unaffected. When Prochlorococcus populations entered
              stationary phase, this commensal relationship rapidly became
              amensal, as SAR11 abundances decreased dramatically. In parallel
              experiments with copiotrophic bacteria; however, the

              to meet SAR11's central requirement for organic carbon, but not
              reduced sulfur. Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, but not MED4,
              could meet the unique glycine requirement of SAR11, which could
              be due to the production and release of glycine betaine by

              MIT9313 may compete with SAR11 for the uptake of
              3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). To give our results an
              ecological context, we assessed the relative contribution of
              Prochlorococcus and SAR11 genome equivalents to those of
              identifiable bacteria and archaea in over 800 marine metagenomes.
              At many locations, more than half of the identifiable genome

              require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering.
              However, clustering hundreds of millions of sequences is
              impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale
              as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is
              typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that
              increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the
              first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent
              of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the
              available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic
              sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50\% sequence

               sequencing to estimate the relative abundances of these groups.

              with the expectation that species should occupy distinct

              of the digestive tract that affects millions of people worldwide.
              Genetic, environmental and microbial factors have been implicated
              in the onset and exacerbation of IBD. However, the mechanisms
              associating gut microbial dysbioses and aberrant immune responses
              remain largely unknown. The integrative Human Microbiome Project
              seeks to close these gaps by examining the dynamics of microbiome
              functionality in disease by profiling the gut microbiomes of >100
              individuals sampled over a 1-year period. Here, we present the
              first results based on 78 paired faecal metagenomes and
              metatranscriptomes, and 222 additional metagenomes from 59
              patients with Crohn's disease, 34 with ulcerative colitis and 24
              non-IBD control patients. We demonstrate several cases in which
              measures of microbial gene expression in the inflamed gut can be
              informative relative to metagenomic profiles of functional
              potential. First, although many microbial organisms exhibited
              concordant DNA and RNA abundances, we also detected
              species-specific biases in transcriptional activity, revealing
              predominant transcription of pathways by individual
              microorganisms per host (for example, by Faecalibacterium
              prausnitzii). Thus, a loss of these organisms in disease may have
              more far-reaching consequences than suggested by their genomic
              abundances. Furthermore, we identified organisms that were
              metagenomically abundant but inactive or dormant in the gut with
              little or no expression (for example, Dialister invisus). Last,
              certain disease-specific microbial characteristics were more
              pronounced or only detectable at the transcript level, such as
              pathways that were predominantly expressed by different organisms
              in patients with IBD (for example, Bacteroides vulgatus and
              Alistipes putredinis). This provides potential insights into gut
              microbial pathway transcription that can vary over time, inducing
              phenotypical changes that are complementary to those linked to
              metagenomic abundances. The study's results highlight the
              strength of analysing both the activity and the presence of gut
              microorganisms to provide insight into the role of the microbiome

  abstract = "The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's
              disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial
              chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has
              been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota,
              changes in the gut metabolome-the molecular interface between
              host and microbiota-are less well understood. To address this
              gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic
              profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n =
              155) and validation (n = 65) cohorts of CD, UC and non-IBD
              control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were
              broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of
              gut inflammation). Across >8,000 measured metabolite features, we
              identified chemicals and chemical classes that were
              differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for
              sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols
              and tetrapyrroles. While > 50\% of differentially abundant
              metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned
              putative roles through metabolomic 'guilt by association'
              (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant
              species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected
              adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were
              individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these
              data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between
              differentially abundant species and well-characterized
              differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible
              mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we
              found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD
              status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of
              individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation
              cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of
              perturbations of the microbiome-metabolome interface in IBD,
              including identification of many potential diagnostic and
              therapeutic targets.",

              samples isolated from patients in 244 hospitals in 32 countries
              during the European Survey of Carbapenemase-Producing
              Enterobacteriaceae. We demonstrate that carbapenemase acquisition
              is the main cause of carbapenem resistance and that it occurred
              across diverse phylogenetic backgrounds. However, 477 of 682
              (69.9\%) carbapenemase-positive isolates are concentrated in four
              clonal lineages, sequence types 11, 15, 101, 258/512 and their

              interhospital spread is far more frequent within, rather than
              between, countries. Finally, we propose a value of 21 for the

              supported by virome surveys and examples of high genomic
              mosaicism. However, recent evidence suggests that the human gut

              epidemiology of crAssphage, a widespread human gut virus. Through
              a global collaboration, we obtained DNA sequences of crAssphage
              from more than one-third of the world's countries and showed that
              the phylogeography of crAssphage is locally clustered within
              countries, cities and individuals. We also found fully colinear
              crAssphage-like genomes in both Old-World and New-World primates,
              suggesting that the association of crAssphage with primates may
              be millions of years old. Finally, by exploiting a large cohort
              of more than 1,000 individuals, we tested whether crAssphage is
              associated with bacterial taxonomic groups of the gut microbiome,
              diverse human health parameters and a wide range of dietary
              factors. We identified strong correlations with different clades

              associations with several diet categories, but no significant

              is that symbionts have evolved to manipulate host behaviour for
              their benefit. Here, we evaluate the manipulation hypothesis by
              applying evolutionary theory to recent work on the gut-brain

              under certain conditions, these appear rarely satisfied by the
              genetically diverse communities of the mammalian microbiome.
              Specifically, any symbiont investing its resources to manipulate
              host behaviour is expected to be outcompeted within the
              microbiome by strains that do not manipulate and redirect their
              resources into growth and survival. Moreover, current data

              Listeria monocytogenes uses a distinctive flavin-based EET
              mechanism to deliver electrons to iron or an electrode. By
              performing a forward genetic screen to identify L. monocytogenes
              mutants with diminished extracellular ferric iron reductase
              activity, we identified an eight-gene locus that is responsible
              for EET. This locus encodes a specialized NADH dehydrogenase that
              segregates EET from aerobic respiration by channelling electrons
              to a discrete membrane-localized quinone pool. Other proteins
              facilitate the assembly of an abundant extracellular flavoprotein
              that, in conjunction with free-molecule flavin shuttles, mediates
              electron transfer to extracellular acceptors. This system thus
              establishes a simple electron conduit that is compatible with the
              single-membrane structure of the Gram-positive cell. Activation
              of EET supports growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and an

              courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a
              virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By
              causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor

              pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6-8. There is an urgent need

              shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at
              7.11 $\times$ 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious
              virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples,
              but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA
              concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active
              replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA
              intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus
              populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples
              from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding
              of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms.
              Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50\% of patients (14 days
              in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load.
              COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

              is a recently described species of Enterobacter, associated with
              neonatal sepsis. Here we demonstrate that the extended spectrum
              {\ss}-lactam (ESBL) producing isolate EB-247 is highly virulent
              in both Galleria mellonella and mouse models of infection.
              Infection studies in a streptomycin-treated mouse model showed
              that EB-247 is as efficient as Salmonella Typhimurium in inducing
              systemic infection and release of proinflammatory cytokines.
              Sequencing and analysis of the complete genome and plasmid
              revealed that virulence properties are associated with the
              chromosome, while antibiotic-resistance genes are exclusively
              present on a 299 kb IncHI plasmid. EB-247 grew in high
              concentrations of human serum indicating septicemic potential.
              Using whole genome-based transcriptome analysis we found 7\% of
              the genome was mobilized for growth in serum. Upregulated genes
              include those involved in the iron uptake and storage as well as
              metabolism. The lasso peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25), an inhibitor
              of iron-uptake and RNA polymerase activity, inhibited EB-247
              growth. Our studies indicate that Enterobacter bugandensis is a

              sequencing errors are largely random. Using low coverage ONT
              minION sequencing for genotyping of pre-validated SNP loci was
              examined in 9 canola doubled haploids. The minION genotypes were

              Interestingly, primers and PCR conditions used for the Sanger
              approach did not require optimisation to construct the MiSeq
              library. After quality controls, 87\% of the species (76\% of the
              specimens) had a valid MiSeq sequence for each marker.
              Importantly, major clusters did not always correspond to the
              targeted loci. Nine specimens exhibited two divergent sequences
              (up to 10\%). In 95\% of the species, MiSeq and Sanger sequences

              environmental bacteria. In this context, $\beta$-lactamases (BLs)
              are of great interest due to their long-term presence and
              diversification in the hospital environment, leading to the

               However, to analyse few molecules, preamplification is required.
               Here, we studied global and target-specific preamplification
               using 96 optimised qPCR assays. To evaluate the preamplification
               strategies, we monitored the reactions in real-time using SYBR
               Green I detection chemistry followed by melting curve analysis.
               Next, we compared yield and reproducibility of global
               preamplification to that of target-specific preamplification by
               qPCR using the same amount of total RNA. Global preamplification
               generated 9.3-fold lower yield and 1.6-fold lower
               reproducibility than target-specific preamplification. However,
               the performance of global preamplification is sufficient for

              effect of this policy on the pattern of erythromycin resistance
              throughout Finland. METHODS: From 1991 through 1996, a total of
              39,247 group A streptococcal isolates from throat swabs (82
              percent of the isolates) and pus samples (18 percent) and 290
              isolates from blood cultures were studied in regional
              microbiology laboratories. The susceptibility of the isolates to
              erythromycin was tested by the disk-diffusion or the
              screening-plate method. RESULTS: Consumption of macrolide
              antibiotics decreased from 2.40 defined daily doses per 1000

              identification of a cluster of C. auris infections in the
              neurosciences intensive care unit (ICU) of the Oxford University
              Hospitals, United Kingdom, we instituted an intensive patient and
              environmental screening program and package of interventions.
              Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors
              of C. auris colonization and infection. Isolates from patients
              and from the environment were analyzed by whole-genome
              sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were identified as
              being colonized or infected with C. auris between February 2,
              2015, and August 31, 2017; of these patients, 66 (94\%) had been
              admitted to the neurosciences ICU before diagnosis. Invasive C.
              auris infections developed in 7 patients. When length of stay in
              the neurosciences ICU and patient vital signs and laboratory
              results were controlled for, the predictors of C. auris
              colonization or infection included the use of reusable
              skin-surface axillary temperature probes (multivariable odds
              ratio, 6.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.96 to 15.63;
              P<0.001) and systemic fluconazole exposure (multivariable odds
              ratio, 10.34; 95\% CI, 1.64 to 65.18; P=0.01). C. auris was
              rarely detected in the general environment. However, it was
              detected in isolates from reusable equipment, including multiple
              axillary skin-surface temperature probes. Despite a bundle of
              infection-control interventions, the incidence of new cases was
              reduced only after removal of the temperature probes. All
              outbreak sequences formed a single genetic cluster within the C.
              auris South African clade. The sequenced isolates from reusable
              equipment were genetically related to isolates from the patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: The transmission of C. auris in this hospital

              probes, indicating that this emerging pathogen can persist in the

              drug-susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
              for all patients with tuberculosis to guide treatment decisions
              and improve outcomes. Whether DNA sequencing can be used to
              accurately predict profiles of susceptibility to first-line
              antituberculosis drugs has not been clear. METHODS: We obtained
              whole-genome sequences and associated phenotypes of resistance or
              susceptibility to the first-line antituberculosis drugs
              isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for isolates
              from 16 countries across six continents. For each isolate,
              mutations associated with drug resistance and drug susceptibility
              were identified across nine genes, and individual phenotypes were
              predicted unless mutations of unknown association were also
              present. To identify how whole-genome sequencing might direct
              first-line drug therapy, complete susceptibility profiles were
              predicted. These profiles were predicted to be susceptible to all
              four drugs (i.e., pansusceptible) if they were predicted to be
              susceptible to isoniazid and to the other drugs or if they
              contained mutations of unknown association in genes that affect
              susceptibility to the other drugs. We simulated the way in which
              the negative predictive value changed with the prevalence of drug
              resistance. RESULTS: A total of 10,209 isolates were analyzed.
              The largest proportion of phenotypes was predicted for rifampin
              (9660 [95.4\%] of 10,130) and the smallest was predicted for
              ethambutol (8794 [89.8\%] of 9794). Resistance to isoniazid,
              rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was correctly predicted
              with 97.1\%, 97.5\%, 94.6\%, and 91.3\% sensitivity,
              respectively, and susceptibility to these drugs was correctly
              predicted with 99.0\%, 98.8\%, 93.6\%, and 96.8\% specificity. Of
              the 7516 isolates with complete phenotypic drug-susceptibility
              profiles, 5865 (78.0\%) had complete genotypic predictions, among
              which 5250 profiles (89.5\%) were correctly predicted. Among the
              4037 phenotypic profiles that were predicted to be
              pansusceptible, 3952 (97.9\%) were correctly predicted.
              CONCLUSIONS: Genotypic predictions of the susceptibility of M.
              tuberculosis to first-line drugs were found to be correlated with
              phenotypic susceptibility to these drugs. (Funded by the Bill and

              of small amounts of template by RCA using phi29 DNA polymerase is
              ``background'' DNA synthesis that usually occurs when template is
              omitted, or at low template concentrations. Reducing the reaction
              volume while keeping the amount of template fixed increases the

              synthesis. Cell-free cloning of single circular molecules by
              using phi29 DNA polymerase was achieved by carrying out the
              amplification reactions in very small volumes, typically 600 nl.
              This procedure allows cell-free cloning of individual synthetic

              polymerase reaction without further amplification. In contrast to
              PCR amplification, RCA using phi29 DNA polymerase does not
              produce mutant jackpots, and the high processivity of the enzyme
              eliminates stuttering at homopolymer tracts. Cell-free cloning

              a numerical and relatively stable species boundary, and its use
              has had a paramount influence on how the current classification

              the descendants of a single human-to-poultry host jump that
              occurred approximately 38 years ago (range, 30 to 63 years ago)

              32-kb (+)-strand molecule that replicates in the cytoplasm.
              During virus replication, a 3' coterminal nested set of five to
              eight subgenomic (sg) mRNAs are made that are also 5' coterminal
              with the genome, because they carry the genomic leader as the
              result of discontinuous transcription at intergenic donor signals
              during (-)-strand synthesis when templates for sgmRNA synthesis
              are made. An unanswered question is whether the sgmRNAs, which
              appear rapidly and abundantly, undergo posttranscriptional
              amplification. Here, using RT-PCR and sequence analyses of
              head-to-tail-ligated (-) strands, we show that after transfection
              of an in vitro-generated marked sgmRNA into virus-infected cells,
              the sgmRNA, like the genome, can function as a template for
              (-)-strand synthesis. Furthermore, when the transfected sgmRNA
              contains an internally placed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
              template-switching donor signal, discontinuous transcription
              occurs at this site, and a shorter, 3' terminally nested
              leader-containing sgmRNA is made, as evidenced by its leader-body
              junction and by the expression of a GFP gene. Thus, in principle,
              the longer-nested sgmRNAs in a natural infection, all of which
              contain potential internal template-switching donor signals, can
              function to increase the number of the shorter 3'-nested sgmRNAs.
              One predicted advantage of this behavior for coronavirus
              survivability is an increased chance of maintaining genome
              fitness in the 3' one-third of the genome via a homologous

              Salmonella, and Citrobacter, or E. coli, E. fergusonii, and E.

              topology more robustly than expected from stochastic sequence
              homoplasies. Clustering of phylogenetically informative sites on
              the genome indicated that the regions of recombination extended

              changes in abundance over time and by examining the ratio of 16S
              rRNA to rRNA genes (rDNA) of individual bacterial taxa. The V1-V2
              region of 16S rRNA and rDNA was analyzed by tag pyrosequencing in
              a 3-y study of surface waters off the Delaware coast. Over half

              avian strains with serotypes H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, H8, H10, H11,

              reassortant gained two mutations in the M2 proton channel gate

              mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal
              barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is
              difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and
              can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear
              ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of
              three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA
              polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and
              minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding
              gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification
              compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and
              sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal
              fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the
              internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest
              probability of successful identification for the broadest range
              of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between
              inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large
              subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had
              superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the
              early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was

              between that of insect viruses and mammalian picornaviruses, HAV
              is enigmatic in its origins. We conducted a targeted search for
              hepatoviruses in 15,987 specimens collected from 209 small mammal
              species globally and discovered highly diversified viruses in
              bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews, which by pairwise sequence
              distance comprise 13 novel Hepatovirus species. Near-complete
              genomes from nine of these species show conservation of unique
              hepatovirus features, including predicted internal ribosome entry

              Limited phylogenetic cosegregation among hepatoviruses and their
              hosts and recombination patterns are indicative of major
              hepatovirus host shifts in the past. Ancestral state

  abstract = "The early detection of pathogens with epidemic potential is of
              major importance to public health. Most emerging infections
              result in dead-end ``spillover'' events in which a pathogen is
              transmitted from an animal reservoir to a human but is unable to
              achieve the sustained human-to-human transmission necessary for a
              full-blown epidemic. It is therefore critical to determine why
              only some virus infections are efficiently transmitted among
              humans whereas others are not. We sought to determine which
              biological features best characterized those viruses that have
              achieved sustained human transmission. Accordingly, we compiled a
              database of 203 RNA and DNA human viruses and used an information
              theoretic approach to assess which of a set of key biological
              variables were the best predictors of human-to-human
              transmission. The variables analyzed were as follows: taxonomic
              classification; genome length, type, and segmentation; the
              presence or absence of an outer envelope; recombination
              frequency; duration of infection; host mortality; and whether or
              not a virus exhibits vector-borne transmission. This comparative
              analysis revealed multiple strong associations. In particular, we
              determined that viruses with low host mortality, that establish
              long-term chronic infections, and that are nonsegmented,
              nonenveloped, and, most importantly, not transmitted by vectors
              were more likely to be transmissible among humans. In contrast,
              variables including genome length, genome type, and recombination
              frequency had little predictive power. In sum, we have identified
              multiple biological features that seemingly determine the
              likelihood of interhuman viral transmissibility, in turn enabling
              general predictions of whether viruses of a particular type will

              datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans

              the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not

              extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition,

  abstract = "The resolution of four controversial topics in phylogenetic
              experimental design hinges upon the informativeness of characters
              about the historical relationships among taxa. These
              controversies regard the power of different classes of
              phylogenetic character, the relative utility of increased
              taxonomic versus character sampling, the differentiation between
              lack of phylogenetic signal and a historical rapid radiation, and
              the design of taxonomically broad phylogenetic studies optimized
              by taxonomically sparse genome-scale data. Quantification of the
              informativeness of characters for resolution of phylogenetic
              hypotheses during specified historical epochs is key to the
              resolution of these controversies. Here, such a measure of
              phylogenetic informativeness is formulated. The optimal rate of
              evolution of a character to resolve a dated four-taxon polytomy
              is derived. By scaling the asymptotic informativeness of a
              character evolving at a nonoptimal rate by the derived asymptotic
              optimum, and by normalizing so that net phylogenetic
              informativeness is equivalent for all rates when integrated
              across all of history, an informativeness profile across history
              is derived. Calculation of the informativeness per base pair
              allows estimation of the cost-effectiveness of character
              sampling. Calculation of the informativeness per million years
              allows comparison across historical radiations of the utility of
              a gene for the inference of rapid adaptive radiation. The theory
              is applied to profile the phylogenetic informativeness of the
              genes BRCA1, RAG1, GHR, and c-myc from a muroid rodent sequence
              data set. Bounded integrations of the phylogenetic profile of
              these genes over four epochs comprising the diversifications of
              the muroid rodents, the mammals, the lobe-limbed vertebrates, and
              the early metazoans demonstrate the differential power of these
              genes to resolve the branching order among ancestral lineages.
              This measure of phylogenetic informativeness yields a new kind of
              information for evaluation of phylogenetic experiments. It
              conveys the utility of the addition of characters a phylogenetic
              study and it provides a basis for deciding whether appropriate
              phylogenetic power has been applied to a polytomy that is
              proposed to be a rapid radiation. Moreover, it provides a

  abstract = "Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic
              reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the
              alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the
              most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on
              the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic
              regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to
              improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such
              regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present
              work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves
              after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein
              alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in
              diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the
              alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously
              developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more
              or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks.
              Alignments constructed with different alignment methods
              (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate
              phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and
              parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for
              alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to
              better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is
              an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best
              trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of
              alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of
              blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent
              selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that
              cleaned alignments produce better topologies although,
              paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that
              divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when
              present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more
              biased topologies.",

              factors associated with mortality among patients with this type
              of infection. SETTING: Mount Sinai Hospital, a 1,171-bed tertiary
              care teaching hospital in New York City. DESIGN: Two matched
              case-control studies. METHODS: In the first matched case-control
              study, case patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
              infection were compared with control patients with
              carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae infection. In the second
              case-control study, patients who survived carbapenem-resistant K.
              pneumoniae infection were compared with those who did not
              survive, to identify risk factors associated with mortality among
              patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection.
              RESULTS: There were 99 case patients and 99 control patients
              identified. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection was
              independently associated with recent organ or stem-cell
              transplantation (P=.008), receipt of mechanical ventilation
              (P=.04), longer length of stay before infection (P=.01), and
              exposure to cephalosporins (P=.02) and carbapenems (P<.001). Case
              patients were more likely than control patients to die during
              hospitalization (48\% vs 20\%; P<.001) and to die from infection
              (38\% vs 12\%; P<.001). Removal of the focus of infection (ie,
              debridement) was independently associated with patient survival
              (P=.002). The timely administration of antibiotics with in vitro
              activity against carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was not

              Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection is associated with

              primers for PCR. The websites used for implementation of Primer3
              have recently been updated. PCR requires Mg(2+)(,) which has a
              significant dsDNA stabilizing effect that must be taken into
              account when designing PCR primers. The data sets and formulas
              used to correct for salt concentrations have been updated in
              Primer3 to give better prediction of melting temperature (T(m)).
              The liberal combination of different formulas for monovalent and
              divalent salt correction can lead to different results, depending
              on the formula chosen by the user. Using published T(m) for 475
              different oligonucleotides, it is shown that the combination of
              the implemented conversion of divalent to monovalent cation
              concentration works well with one salt correction formula but not
              with an alternative one. Use of a more recently described
              alternative formula would lead to equally good T(m) predictions
              if divalent cations are present. The proper selection of
              compatible primer pairs depends on the choice of a good
              combination of salt correction formulas. Currently the SantaLucia
              salt correction formula should be used if Mg(2+) is present. The

              Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach
              hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up
              established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for
              leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic data sets.
              Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and

              computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in

              definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of

              such string matching is the 'seed-and-extend' approach, in which
              occurrences of short subsequences called 'seeds' are used to
              search for potentially longer matches in a large database of
              sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it
              extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend
              approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring
              in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian
              genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have
              such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds
              cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly
              slows the matching process. RESULTS: We present a simple and
              elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called
              'minimizers', needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up

              often results in the creation of only a single sequencing
              library, which in turn introduces new challenges for genome
              assembly methods. RESULTS: We evaluated the ability of multiple

              bacterial species spanning a wide range of GC content and
              measured the contiguity and accuracy of the resulting assemblies.
              We compared the assemblies produced by this very high-coverage,
              one-library strategy to the best assemblies created by
              two-library sequencing, and we found that remarkably good
              bacterial assemblies are possible with just one library. We also

              Intra-cluster molecular function consistency was examined by

              clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function
              in more than 97\% of the clusters, implying that clusters are
              useful for annotation and can also be used to detect annotation
              inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results,
              BLASTP searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit

              bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET (Protein Feature Engineering
              Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of features covering the
              elementary biophysical and sequence derived attributes. Most
              features capture statistically informative patterns. In addition,
              different representations of sequences and the amino acids
              alphabet provide a compact, compressed set of features. The
              results from ProFET were incorporated in data analysis pipelines,
              implemented in python and adapted for multi-genome scale
              analysis. ProFET was applied on 17 established and novel protein
              benchmark datasets involving classification for a variety of
              binary and multi-class tasks. The results show state of the art
              performance. The extracted features' show excellent biological
              interpretability. The success of ProFET applies to a wide range
              of high-level functions such as subcellular localization,
              structural classes and proteins with unique functional properties
              (e.g. neuropeptide precursors, thermophilic and nucleic acid

  title    = "{MMseqs} software suite for fast and deep clustering and
              searching of large protein sequence sets",
  author   = "Hauser, Maria and Steinegger, Martin and S{\"o}ding, Johannes",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Sequence databases are growing fast, challenging
              existing analysis pipelines. Reducing the redundancy of sequence
              databases by similarity clustering improves speed and sensitivity
              of iterative searches. But existing tools cannot efficiently
              cluster databases of the size of UniProt to 50\% maximum pairwise
              sequence identity or below. Furthermore, in metagenomics
              experiments typically large fractions of reads cannot be matched
              to any known sequence anymore because searching with sensitive
              but relatively slow tools (e.g. BLAST or HMMER3) through
              comprehensive databases such as UniProt is becoming too costly.
              RESULTS: MMseqs (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a
              software suite for fast and deep clustering and searching of
              large datasets, such as UniProt, or 6-frame translated
              metagenomics sequencing reads. MMseqs contains three core
              modules: a fast and sensitive prefiltering module that sums up
              the scores of similar k-mers between query and target sequences,
              an SSE2- and multi-core-parallelized local alignment module, and
              a clustering module.In our homology detection benchmarks, MMseqs
              is much more sensitive and 4-30 times faster than UBLAST and
              RAPsearch, respectively, although it does not reach BLAST
              sensitivity yet. Using its cascaded clustering workflow, MMseqs
              can cluster large databases down to ∼30\% sequence identity at
              hundreds of times the speed of BLASTclust and much deeper than
              CD-HIT and USEARCH. MMseqs can also update a database clustering
              in linear instead of quadratic time. Its much improved
              sensitivity-speed trade-off should make MMseqs attractive for a
              wide range of large-scale sequence analysis tasks. AVAILABILITY

               multiple sequence alignment program",

  abstract  = "Motivation: We present a new feature of the MAFFT multiple
               alignment program for suppressing over-alignment (aligning
               unrelated segments). Conventional MAFFT is highly sensitive in
               aligning conserved regions in remote homologs, but the risk of
               over-alignment is recently becoming greater, as low-quality or
               noisy sequences are increasing in protein sequence databases,
               due, for example, to sequencing errors and difficulty in gene
               prediction.Results: The proposed method utilizes a variable
               scoring matrix for different pairs of sequences (or groups) in a
               single multiple sequence alignment, based on the global
               similarity of each pair. This method significantly increases the
               correctly gapped sites in real examples and in simulations under
               various conditions. Regarding sensitivity, the effect of the
               proposed method is slightly negative in real protein-based
               benchmarks, and mostly neutral in simulation-based benchmarks.
               This approach is based on natural biological reasoning and
               should be compatible with many methods based on dynamic
               programming for multiple sequence alignment.Availability and

  author   = "Salmela, Leena and Walve, Riku and Rivals, Eric and Ukkonen, Esko",
  abstract = "Motivation: New long read sequencing technologies, like PacBio
              SMRT and Oxford NanoPore, can produce sequencing reads up to 50
              000 bp long but with an error rate of at least 15\%. Reducing the
              error rate is necessary for subsequent utilization of the reads
              in, e.g. de novo genome assembly. The error correction problem
              has been tackled either by aligning the long reads against each
              other or by a hybrid approach that uses the more accurate short
              reads produced by second generation sequencing technologies to
              correct the long reads. Results: We present an error correction
              method that uses long reads only. The method consists of two
              phases: first, we use an iterative alignment-free correction
              method based on de Bruijn graphs with increasing length of k
              -mers, and second, the corrected reads are further polished using
              long-distance dependencies that are found using multiple
              alignments. According to our experiments, the proposed method is
              the most accurate one relying on long reads only for read sets
              with high coverage. Furthermore, when the coverage of the read
              set is at least 75$\times$, the throughput of the new method is

              Moore's Law, more than doubling every 2 years since the
              next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were invented.
              Accordingly, we will able to generate more and more data with
              high speed at fixed cost, but lack the computational resources to
              store, process and analyze it. With error prone high throughput
              NGS reads and genomic repeats, the assembly graph contains
              massive amount of redundant nodes and branching edges. Most
              assembly pipelines require this large graph to reside in memory
              to start their workflows, which is intractable for mammalian
              genomes. Resource-efficient genome assemblers combine both the
              power of advanced computing techniques and innovative data
              structures to encode the assembly graph efficiently in a computer
              memory. RESULTS: LightAssembler is a lightweight assembly
              algorithm designed to be executed on a desktop machine. It uses a
              pair of cache oblivious Bloom filters, one holding a uniform
              sample of [Formula: see text]-spaced sequenced [Formula: see
              text]-mers and the other holding [Formula: see text]-mers
              classified as likely correct, using a simple statistical test.
              LightAssembler contains a light implementation of the graph
              traversal and simplification modules that achieves comparable
              assembly accuracy and contiguity to other competing tools. Our

              to the resource-efficient assemblers using benchmark datasets
              from GAGE and Assemblathon projects. While LightAssembler can be

              assigned to taxonomic levels where they are unambiguous. We
              explore connections between metagenomic read assignment and the

              difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of genomes for
              analysis by DNA sequencing. Selective whole-genome amplification
              (SWGA) provides an efficient approach to amplify microbial
              genomes from complex backgrounds for sequence acquisition.
              However, the process of designing sets of primers for this method
              has many degrees of freedom and would benefit from an automated
              process to evaluate the vast number of potential primer sets.
              Results: Here, we present swga , a program that identifies primer
              sets for SWGA and evaluates them for efficiency and selectivity.
              We used swga to design and test primer sets for the selective
              amplification of Wolbachia pipientis genomic DNA from infected
              Drosophila melanogaster and Mycobacterium tuberculosis from human

  abstract = "Motivation: Protein domain prediction is one of the most powerful
              approaches for sequence-based function prediction. Although
              domain instances are typically predicted independently of each
              other, newer approaches have demonstrated improved performance by
              rewarding domain pairs that frequently co-occur within sequences.
              However, most of these approaches have ignored the order in which
              domains preferentially co-occur and have also not modeled domain
              co-occurrence probabilistically. Results: We introduce a
              probabilistic approach for domain prediction that models
              'directional' domain context. Our method is the first to score
              all domain pairs within a sequence while taking their order into
              account, even for non-sequential domains. We show that our
              approach extends a previous Markov model-based approach to
              additionally score all pairwise terms, and that it can be
              interpreted within the context of Markov random fields. We
              formulate our underlying combinatorial optimization problem as an
              integer linear program, and demonstrate that it can be solved
              quickly in practice. Finally, we perform extensive evaluation of
              domain context methods and demonstrate that incorporating context

              symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural networks to
              generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information

              embeddings contain both explicit and implicit information. We
              apply these embeddings to the prediction of edges in the

              significant amount of noise and missing data (sampling zeros).
              Accounting uncertainty in microbiome data is often challenging
              due to the difficulty of obtaining biological replicates.
              Additionally, the compositional nature of current amplicon and

              address these challenges in human microbiome research, we
              introduce a novel probabilistic approach to explicitly model
              overdispersion and sampling zeros by considering the temporal

              The proposed Temporal Gaussian Process Model for Compositional

              unseen sequences without requiring an understanding of the
              underlying physical or biological mechanisms. Such models enable
              the prediction and discovery of sequences with optimal
              properties. Machine-learning models generally require that their
              inputs be vectors, and the conversion from a protein sequence to
              a vector representation affects the model's ability to learn. We
              propose to learn embedded representations of protein sequences
              that take advantage of the vast quantity of unmeasured protein
              sequence data available. These embeddings are low-dimensional and
              can greatly simplify downstream modeling. Results: The predictive
              power of Gaussian process models trained using embeddings is
              comparable to those trained on existing representations, which
              suggests that embeddings enable accurate predictions despite

  abstract = "Motivation: The effective representation of proteins is a crucial
              task that directly affects the performance of many bioinformatics
              problems. Related proteins usually bind to similar ligands.
              Chemical characteristics of ligands are known to capture the
              functional and mechanistic properties of proteins suggesting that
              a ligand-based approach can be utilized in protein
              representation. In this study, we propose SMILESVec, a Simplified
              molecular input line entry system (SMILES)-based method to
              represent ligands and a novel method to compute similarity of
              proteins by describing them based on their ligands. The proteins
              are defined utilizing the word-embeddings of the SMILES strings
              of their ligands. The performance of the proposed protein
              description method is evaluated in protein clustering task using
              TransClust and MCL algorithms. Two other protein representation
              methods that utilize protein sequence, Basic local alignment tool
              and ProtVec, and two compound fingerprint-based protein
              representation methods are compared. Results: We showed that
              ligand-based protein representation, which uses only SMILES
              strings of the ligands that proteins bind to, performs as well as
              protein sequence-based representation methods in protein
              clustering. The results suggest that ligand-based protein
              description can be an alternative to the traditional sequence or
              structure-based representation of proteins and this novel
              approach can be applied to different bioinformatics problems such
              as prediction of new protein-ligand interactions and protein

  abstract = "Motivation: Indexing reference sequences for search-both
              individual genomes and collections of genomes-is an important
              building block for many sequence analysis tasks. Much work has
              been dedicated to developing full-text indices for genomic
              sequences, based on data structures such as the suffix array, the
              BWT and the FM-index. However, the de Bruijn graph, commonly used
              for sequence assembly, has recently been gaining attention as an
              indexing data structure, due to its natural ability to represent
              multiple references using a graphical structure, and to collapse
              highly-repetitive sequence regions. Yet, much less attention has
              been given as to how to best index such a structure, such that
              queries can be performed efficiently and memory usage remains
              practical as the size and number of reference sequences being
              indexed grows large. Results: We present a novel data structure
              for representing and indexing the compacted colored de Bruijn
              graph, which allows for efficient pattern matching and retrieval
              of the reference information associated with each k-mer. As the
              popularity of the de Bruijn graph as an index has increased over
              the past few years, so have the number of proposed
              representations of this structure. Existing structures typically
              fall into two categories; those that are hashing-based and
              provide very fast access to the underlying k-mer information, and
              those that are space-frugal and provide asymptotically efficient
              but practically slower pattern search. Our representation
              achieves a compromise between these two extremes. By building
              upon minimum perfect hashing and making use of succinct
              representations where applicable, our data structure provides
              practically fast lookup while greatly reducing the space compared
              to traditional hashing-based implementations. Further, we
              describe a sampling scheme for this index, which provides the
              ability to trade off query speed for a reduction in the index
              size. We believe this representation strikes a desirable balance
              between speed and space usage, and allows for fast search on
              large reference sequences. Finally, we describe an application of
              this index to the taxonomic read assignment problem. We show that
              by adopting, essentially, the approach of Kraken, but replacing
              k-mer presence with coverage by chains of consistent unique
              maximal matches, we can improve the space, speed and accuracy of
              taxonomic read assignment. Availability and implementation:

              different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and
              cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene

              phenotypes from 16S rRNA gene sequencing based on k-mer
              representations that benefits from a bootstrapping framework for

              (i) skipping computationally costly sequence alignments required
              in OTU-picking and (ii) provided a proof of concept for the
              sufficiency of shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for
              phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features predicted
              representative 16S rRNA gene sequences of 18 ecological

              Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are particularly at risk. Kp

              colonization and its contribution to infections are not well
              characterized. Methods: We conducted a one-year prospective
              cohort study in which 498 ICU patients were screened for rectal
              and throat carriage of Kp shortly after admission. Kp isolated
              from screening swabs and clinical diagnostic samples were
              characterized using whole genome sequencing and combined with
              epidemiological data to identify likely transmission events.
              Results: Kp carriage frequencies were estimated at 6\% (95\% CI,
              3\%-8\%) amongst ICU patients admitted direct from the community,
              and 19\% (95\% CI, 14\% - 51\%) amongst those with recent
              healthcare contact. Gut colonisation on admission was
              significantly associated with subsequent infection (infection

              matching carriage and infection isolates in 80\% of isolate
              pairs. Five likely transmission chains were identified,
              responsible for 12\% of Kp infections in ICU. 49\% of Kp
              infections were caused by the patients' own unique strain, and
              48\% of screened patients with infections were positive for prior

              the 5' end of the genome fused to different sequences ('bodies')
              derived from the 3' end. Their generation involves a unique
              mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that
              resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the
              nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template
              to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to
              yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are
              transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at
              both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer.
              Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation
              mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating
              that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing
              between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the
              primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely
              plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS fulfils
              multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader-body junctions
              of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step
              occurs during minus strand synthesis.",

  author   = "Brown, Bonnie L and Watson, Mick and Minot, Samuel S and Rivera,

  abstract = "Background: Environmental metagenomic analysis is typically
              accomplished by assigning taxonomy and/or function from whole
              genome sequencing (WGS) or 16S amplicon sequences. Both of these
              approaches are limited, however, by read length, among other
              technical and biological factors. A nanopore-based sequencing
              platform, MinION™, produces reads that are $\geq$1$\times$10 4 bp
              in length, potentially providing for more precise assignment,
              thereby alleviating some of the limitations inherent in
              determining metagenome composition from short reads. We tested
              the ability of sequence data produced by MinION (R7.3 flow cells)
              to correctly assign taxonomy in single bacterial species runs and
              in three types of low complexity synthetic communities: a mixture
              of DNA using equal mass from four species, a community with one
              relatively rare (1\%) and three abundant (33\% each) components,
              and a mixture of genomic DNA from 20 bacterial strains of
              staggered representation. Taxonomic composition of the
              low-complexity communities was assessed by analyzing the MinION
              sequence data with three different bioinformatic approaches:
              Kraken, MG-RAST, and One Codex. Results: Long read sequences
              generated from libraries prepared from single strains using the
              version 5 kit and chemistry, run on the original MinION device,
              yielded as few as 224 to as many as 3,497 bidirectional
              high-quality (2D) reads with an average overall study length of
              6,000 bp. For the single-strain analyses, assignment of reads to
              the correct genus by different methods ranged from 53.1\% to
              99.5\%, assignment to the correct species ranged from 23.9\% to
              99.5\%, and the majority of mis-assigned reads were to closely
              related organisms. A synthetic metagenome sequenced with the same
              setup yielded 714 high quality 2D reads of approximately 5,500 bp
              that were up to 98\% correctly assigned to the species level.
              Synthetic metagenome from MinION libraries generated using
              version 6 kit and chemistry yielded 899-3,497 2D reads with
              lengths averaging 5,700 bp with up to 98\% assignment accuracy at
              the species-level. The observed community proportions for
              ``equal'' and ``rare'' synthetic libraries were close to the
              known proportions, deviating from 0.1 - 10\% across all tests.
              For a 20-species mock community with staggered contributions, a
              sequencing run detected all but 3 species (each included at 99\%
              of reads were assigned to the correct family. Conclusions: At the
              current level of output and sequence quality (just under
              4$\times$10 3 2D reads for a synthetic metagenome), MinION
              sequencing followed by Kraken or One Codex analysis has the
              potential to provide rapid and accurate metagenomic analysis
              where the consortium is comprised of a limited number of taxa.
              Important considerations noted in this study included: high
              sensitivity of the MinION platform to the quality of input DNA,
              high variability of sequencing results across libraries and flow
              cells, and relatively small numbers of 2D reads per analysis
              limit. Together, these limited detection of very rare components
              of the microbial consortia, and would likely limit the utility of
              MinION for the sequencing of high-complexity metagenomic
              communities where thousands of taxa are expected. Furthermore,
              the limitations of the currently available data analysis tools
              suggest there is considerable room for improvement in the
              analytical approaches for the characterization of microbial
              communities using long reads. Nevertheless, the fact that the
              accurate taxonomic assignment of high quality reads generated by
              MinION is approaching 99.5\% and, in most cases, the inferred
              community structure mirrors the known proportions of a synthetic
              mixture, warrants further exploration of practical application to
              environmental metagenomics as the platform continues to develop
              and improve. With further improvement in sequence throughput and
              error rate reduction, this platform shows great promise for
              precise real-time analysis of the composition and structure of
              more complex microbial communities.",

              thought to be extinct for 28 years. Sequences generated on the
              MinION required as few as 30 reads to achieve high accuracy
              relative to Sanger sequencing, and with further multiplexing of
              samples, nanopore sequencing can become a cost-effective approach
              for rapid and portable DNA barcoding. Conclusions: Overall, we
              establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can
              help to accelerate species identification in remote areas to aid
              in conservation efforts and be applied to research facilities in
              developing countries. This opens up possibilities for
              biodiversity studies by promoting local research capacity

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In recent years, massively parallel complementary DNA
              sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq]) has emerged as a fast,
              cost-effective, and robust technology to study entire
              transcriptomes in various manners. In particular, for non-model
              organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome,
              RNA-Seq is used to reconstruct the transcriptome de novo.
              Although the de novo transcriptome assembly of non-model
              organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are
              frequently developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which
              assembly software should be used to build a comprehensive de novo
              assembly. RESULTS: Here, we present a large-scale comparative
              study in which 10 de novo assembly tools are applied to 9 RNA-Seq
              data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built
              >200 single assemblies and evaluated their performance on a
              combination of 20 biological-based and reference-free metrics.
              Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and extensible
              Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly
              execution instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes,
              and Trans-ABySS, followed by Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans,
              generally outperformed the other tools compared. Moreover, we
              observed species-specific differences in the performance of each
              assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets.
              CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a careful choice and normalization of
              evaluation metrics to select the best assembling results as a
              critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive de novo

              potential for the study of microbial communities. However, the
              best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are
              unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics
              tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated
              samples with known composition. FINDINGS: We sequenced 2
              commercially available mock communities containing 10 microbial
              species (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford
              Nanopore GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10
              individual species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina
              technology. We generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION
              flowcells and 150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION
              flowcells for the evenly distributed and log-distributed

              5.4 kilobase pairs over the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and
              corresponding signal data are made available (4.2 TB in total).
              Alignment to Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the
              expected microbial species at anticipated abundances, with the
              limit of detection for the lowest abundance species below 50

              These datasets will be useful for those developing bioinformatics

  author    = "Komar, Anton A",
  abstract  = "The genetic code is degenerate. With the exception of two amino
               acids (Met and Trp), all other amino acid residues are each
               encoded by multiple, so-called synonymous codons. Synonymous
               codons were initially presumed to have entirely equivalent
               functions, however, the finding that synonymous codons are not
               present at equal frequencies in genes/genomes suggested that
               codon choice might have functional implications beyond amino
               acid coding. The pattern of non-uniform codon use (known as
               codon usage bias) varies between organisms and represents a
               unique feature of an organism. Organism-specific codon choice is
               related to organism-specific differences in populations of
               cognate tRNAs. This implies that, in a given organism,
               frequently used codons will be translated more rapidly than
               infrequently used ones and vice versa A theory of codon-tRNA
               co-evolution (necessary to balance accurate and efficient
               protein production) was put forward to explain the existence of
               codon usage bias. This model suggests that selection favours
               preferred (frequent) over un-preferred (rare) codons in order to
               sustain efficient protein production in cells and that a given
               un-preferred codon will have the same effect on an organism's
               fitness regardless of its position within an mRNA's open reading
               frame. However, many recent studies refute this prediction.
               Un-preferred codons have been found to have important functional
               roles and their effects appeared to be position-dependent.
               Synonymous codon usage affects the efficiency/stringency of mRNA
               decoding, mRNA biogenesis/stability, and protein secretion and
               folding. This review summarizes recent developments in the field

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes is
              important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the
              epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of
              whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes
              increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is
              anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene
              identification. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the
              relevant information from the large amount of generated data.
              METHODS: We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses
              BLAST for identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance
              genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both
              pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence
              reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was
              evaluated on 1862 GenBank files containing 1411 different
              resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates.
              RESULTS: When testing the 1862 GenBank files, the method
              identified the resistance genes with an ID = 100\% (100\%
              identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico
              predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was
              further tested on 23 isolates of five different bacterial
              species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was
              evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven
              of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial
              resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with
              the ResFinder results. CONCLUSIONS: A web server providing a
              convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance
              genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can
              be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will
              continuously be updated as new resistance genes are identified.",

              protein as a source of colistin resistance in a series of K.
              pneumoniae. METHODS: Colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates
              were recovered from hospitalized patients worldwide (France,
              Turkey, Colombia and South Africa). The mgrB gene was amplified
              and sequenced. A wild-type mgrB gene was cloned and the
              corresponding recombinant plasmid was used for complementation
              assays. Clonal diversity was evaluated by MLST and Diversilab
              analysis. RESULTS: Of 47 colistin-resistant isolates, 12 were
              identified as having a mutated mgrB gene. Five clonally unrelated
              isolates had an mgrB gene truncated by an IS5-like IS, while one
              clone also harboured an insertional inactivation at the exact
              same position of the mgrB gene, but with ISKpn13. Another clone
              harboured an insertional inactivation due to ISKpn14 at another
              location of the mgrB gene. Two clonally related isolates
              harboured an IS (IS10R) in the promoter region of mgrB. Finally,
              three clonally unrelated isolates harboured substitutions leading
              to anticipated stop codon in the MgrB protein. Complementation
              assays with a wild-type MgrB protein restored full susceptibility
              to colistin for all colistin-resistant isolates identified with
              qualitative or quantitative MgrB modifications. CONCLUSION: The
              inactivation or down-regulation of the mgrB gene was shown to be
              a source of colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae. Interestingly,

              urinary tract infections as an exemplar. METHODS: Bacterial DNA
              was enriched from clinical urines (n = 10) and from healthy
              urines 'spiked' with multiresistant Escherichia coli (n = 5),

              correctly identified pathogens without culture and, among 55
              acquired resistance genes detected in the cultivated bacteria by
              Illumina sequencing, 51 were found by MinION sequencing directly

  abstract = "RATIONALE: Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to
              modern medicine and increasing international mobility facilitates
              the spread of AMR. Infections with resistant organisms have
              higher morbidity and mortality, are costlier to treat, result in
              longer hospital stays, and place a greater burden on health
              systems than infections caused by susceptible organisms. Here we
              review the role of travel in the international dissemination of
              antimicrobial resistance and consider actions at the levels of
              travelers, travel medicine practitioners, and policymakers that
              would mitigate this threat. FINDINGS: Resistant pathogens do not
              recognize international borders; travelers to areas with high AMR
              prevalence are likely to be exposed to resistant bacteria and
              return to their home countries colonized. Medical tourists go
              between health facilities with drastically different rates of
              AMR, potentially transmitting highly resistant
              strains.Drug-resistant bacteria have been found in every
              continent, however, differences between countries in the
              prevalence of AMR depend on multiple factors. These include
              levels of antibiotic consumption (including inappropriate use),
              access to clean water, adequate sanitation, vaccination coverage,
              the availability of quality healthcare, and access to high
              quality medical products. CONCLUSIONS: Travelers to areas with
              high levels of AMR should have vaccines up to date, be aware of
              ways of treating and preventing travelers' diarrhea (other than
              antibiotic use) and be informed on safe sexual practices. The
              healthcare systems of low- and middle-income countries require
              investment to reduce the transmission of resistant strains by
              improving access to clean water, sanitation facilities and
              vaccines. Efforts are needed to curb inappropriate antibiotic use
              worldwide. In addition, more surveillance is needed to understand
              the role of the movement of humans, livestock and food products
              in resistance transmission. The travel medicine community has a
              key role to play in advocating for the recognition of AMR as a
              priority on the international health agenda. KEY POLICY
              RECOMMENDATIONS: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to modern
              medicine and international travel plays a key role in the spread
              of highly resistant strains. It is essential that this is
              addressed at multiple levels: Individual travelers can reduce

              biodiversity. DNA from approximately 500 beetle specimens,
              originating from a single rainforest canopy fogging sample from

              assembly of complete and partial mitogenomes for 175 species. The

              which isolates within the outbreak are most closely related to
              each other. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic trees typically used
              to represent this variation are not directly informative about
              who infected whom-a phylogenetic tree is not a transmission tree.
              However, a transmission tree can be inferred from a phylogeny
              while accounting for within-host genetic diversity by coloring
              the branches of a phylogeny according to which host those
              branches were in. Here we extend this approach and show that it
              can be applied to partially sampled and ongoing outbreaks. This
              requires computing the correct probability of an observed

              represent a challenge for computational methods to detect
              recombinations in bacterial genomes. We introduce a novel
              algorithm called fastGEAR which identifies lineages in diverse
              microbial alignments, and recombinations between them and from
              external origins. The algorithm detects both recent
              recombinations (affecting a few isolates) and ancestral
              recombinations between detected lineages (affecting entire
              lineages), thus providing insight into recombinations affecting
              deep branches of the phylogenetic tree. In simulations, fastGEAR
              had comparable power to detect recent recombinations and
              outstanding power to detect the ancestral ones, compared with
              state-of-the-art methods, often with a fraction of computational
              cost. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analyzing a
              collection of 616 whole-genomes of a recombinogenic pathogen
              Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which the method provided a
              high-resolution view of recombination across the genome. We
              examined in detail the penicillin-binding genes across the
              Streptococcus genus, demonstrating previously undetected genetic
              exchanges between different species at these three loci. Hence,

              bacterial genes across multiple species. Finally, fastGEAR

              available from those sources and therefore represent a current
              description of the sequence and its features. Annotations include
              coding regions, conserved domains, tRNAs, sequence tagged sites
              (STS), variation, references, gene and protein product names, and
              database cross-references. Sequence is reviewed and features are
              added using a combined approach of collaboration and other input
              from the scientific community, prediction, propagation from
              GenBank and curation by NCBI staff. The format of all RefSeq
              records is validated, and an increasing number of tests are being

              eight influenza virus gene segments, which have been cloned using
              restriction endonucleases and DNA ligation. However, suitable

              Here, we demonstrate a simple, cost-effective way to sequence the
              full complement of protein coding mitochondrial genes from pooled
              samples using the 454/Roche platform. Multiplexing was achieved
              without the need for expensive indexing tags ('barcodes'). The
              method was trialled with a set of long-range polymerase chain
              reaction (PCR) fragments from 30 species of Coleoptera (beetles)
              sequenced in a 1/16th sector of a sequencing plate. Long contigs
              were produced from the pooled sequences with sequencing depths
              ranging from ∼10 to 100$\times$ per contig. Species identity of
              individual contigs was established via three 'bait' sequences

              conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing. This proved that assembly

              sequencing data. Rather than mapping read segments of pre-defined
              lengths and positions, ViReMa dynamically generates moving read
              segments. ViReMa initially attempts to align the 5' end of a read
              to the reference genome(s) with the Bowtie seed-based alignment.
              A new read segment is then made by either extracting any
              unaligned nucleotides at the 3' end of the read or by trimming
              the first nucleotide from the read. This continues iteratively
              until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed. With
              multiple reference genomes, it is possible to detect

              ClusterFinder algorithm now allows using this probabilistic
              algorithm to detect putative gene clusters of unknown types.
              Also, a new dereplication variant of the ClusterBlast module now

              in 2015 to present PUL predictions in ∼70 Bacteroidetes species
              isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, as well as PULs
              derived from the experimental data reported in the literature. In
              2018 PULDB offers access to 820 genomes, sampled from various
              environments and covering a much wider taxonomical range. A Krona
              dynamic chart was set up to facilitate browsing through taxonomy.
              Literature surveys now allows the presentation of the most recent
              (i) PUL repertoires deduced from RNAseq large-scale experiments,
              (ii) PULs that have been subjected to in-depth biochemical
              analysis and (iii) new Carbohydrate-Active enzyme (CAZyme)
              families that contributed to the refinement of PUL predictions.
              To improve PUL visualization and genome browsing, the previous
              annotation of genes encoding CAZymes, regulators, integrases and
              SusCD has now been expanded to include functionally relevant

              which can necessitate higher levels of starting RNA, increase
              experimental error and potentially introduce bias. We recently
              reported a click-chemistry based method for generating RNAseq
              libraries called 'ClickSeq'. Here, we adapt this method to direct
              the cDNA synthesis specifically toward the 3΄UTR/poly(A) tail
              junction of cellular RNA. With this novel approach, we

              camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current
              human infections in the Middle East. In this article, we use
              phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome
              has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently.
              Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with
              distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the

              introduce the cross-platform software tool, TempEst (formerly
              known as Path-O-Gen), for the visualization and analysis of
              temporally sampled sequence data. Given a molecular phylogeny and

              interactive regression approach to explore the association
              between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates.
              TempEst can be used to (1) assess whether there is sufficient

              molecular clock analysis, and (2) identify sequences whose

               different evolutionary and epidemiological time scales, and are
               likely to fail because of the enormous number of unsampled
               viruses that could conceivably emerge in humans. Although we

              constituent ecotypes is held by molecular approaches that
              identify bacterial ecotypes as DNA sequence clusters. These
              approaches succeed when ecotypes correspond with sequence
              clusters, but some models of bacterial speciation predict a
              one-to-many and others a many-to-one relationship between
              ecotypes and sequence clusters. A further challenge is that
              sequence-based phylogenies often contain a hierarchy of clusters
              and subclusters within clusters, and there is no widely accepted
              theory to guide systematists and ecologists to the size of
              cluster most likely to correspond to ecotypes. While present
              systematics attempts to use universal thresholds of sequence
              divergence to help demarcate species, the recently developed
              'community phylogeny' approach assumes no universal thresholds,
              but demarcates ecotypes based on the analysis of a lineage's
              evolutionary dynamics. Theory-based approaches like this one can
              give a conceptual framework as well as operational criteria for
              hypothesizing the identity and membership of ecotypes from
              sequence data; ecology-based approaches can then confirm that the
              putative ecotypes are actually ecologically distinct. Bacterial
              ecotypes that are demonstrated to have a history of coexistence
              as ecologically distinct lineages (based on sequence analysis)
              and as a prognosis of future coexistence (based on ecological
              differences), are the fundamental units of bacterial ecology and
              evolution, and should be recognized by bacterial systematics.",

              actually distinct from each other, and from the species tree.
              Horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) between genomes are an important
              process of bacterial evolution resulting in a substantial amount
              of phylogenetic conflicts between gene trees. We argue that the

              valid goal. We tentatively assess the amount of phylogenetic
              incongruence caused by HGTs in bacteria by comparing bacterial

              in other populations, especially farm animals, and in the wider

              disease in humans, and are the targets of antibiotic treatment,
              constitute a tiny subset of the overall diversity of bacteria
              that includes the gut microbiota and vast numbers in the soil.
              However, resistance can pass between these different populations;
              and homologous resistance genes have been found in pathogens,
              normal flora and soil bacteria. Farm animals are an important
              component of this complex system: they are exposed to enormous
              quantities of antibiotics (despite attempts at reduction) and act
              as another reservoir of resistance genes. Whole genome sequencing
              is revealing and beginning to quantify the two-way traffic of AMR
              bacteria between the farm and the clinic. Surveillance of
              bacterial disease, drug usage and resistance in livestock is
              still relatively poor, though improving, but achieving better
              antimicrobial stewardship on the farm is challenging: antibiotics
              are an integral part of industrial agriculture and there are very
              few alternatives. Human production and use of antibiotics either
              on the farm or in the clinic is but a recent addition to the
              natural and ancient process of antibiotic production and
              resistance evolution that occurs on a global scale in the soil.
              Viewed in this way, AMR is somewhat analogous to climate change,
              and that suggests that an intergovernmental panel, akin to the

              individual and their similarity in appearance to distantly

              adoption of DNA-based comparisons to study fungal diversity,
              including linking curated DNA sequence data to expertly
              identified voucher specimens. DNA-barcoding approaches in fungi

              antibiotic-resistant bacteria are on the rise, making it harder
              to treat infections. At the same time, evolution of antibiotic
              resistance is probably the best-documented case of contemporary
              evolution. To date, research on antibiotic resistance has largely
              ignored the complexity of interactions that bacteria engage in.
              However, in natural populations, bacteria interact with other
              species; for example, competition and grazing are import
              interactions influencing bacterial population dynamics.
              Furthermore, antibiotic leakage to natural environments can
              radically alter bacterial communities. Overall, we argue that
              eco-evolutionary feedback loops in microbial communities can be
              modified by residual antibiotics and evolution of antibiotic
              resistance. The aim of this review is to connect some of the
              well-established key concepts in evolutionary biology and recent
              advances in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics to research on

              techniques. The maps contain 42 sites for B. garinii and 32 for
              B. afzelii. The mapping studies showed that the two chromosomes
              are linear DNA molecules of 953 and 948 kbp, respectively. A
              comparison of the physical maps of B. garinii and B. afzelii and
              the published map of the other Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia
              burgdorferi [Davidson, B.E., MacDougall, J. \& Saint Girons, I.
              (1992) J Bacteriol 174, 3766-3774] revealed that the three
              chromosomes have few endonuclease sites in common, apart from a
              cluster in rrl (encoding 23S rRNA) and rrs (encoding 16S rRNA).
              Cloned borrelial genes were used as specific hybridization probes
              to construct genetic maps, using the physical maps as a basis.
              The resulting maps contain 41 genetic loci for B. burgdorferi, 39
              for B. garinii, and 33 for B. afzelii. In contrast to the
              physical maps, the three genetic maps are closely related, with
              no detectable differences in gene order along the entire length
              of the chromosome. It is concluded that the chromosomes of these
              three borrelial species have undergone no major rearrangements,
              deletions or insertions during their evolution from a common
              ancestor. Detailed mapping of the region of the B. garinii and B.
              afzelii chromosomes that encodes rRNA revealed that each
              chromosome contains one copy of rrs separated by 5 kbp from two
              copies each of rrl and rrf (encoding 5S rRNA). (ABSTRACT

              descriptions of species and genera. In the past it has been
              determined using conventional, indirect methods, but it is
              nowadays reasonable to calculate the DNA G+C content directly
              from the increasingly available and affordable genome sequences.
              The expected increase in accuracy, however, might alter the way
              in which the G+C content is used for drawing taxonomic
              conclusions. We here re-estimate the literature assumption that
              the G+C content can vary up to 3-5 \% within species using
              genomic datasets. The resulting G+C content differences are
              compared with DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) similarities calculated
              in silico using the GGDC web server, with 70\% similarity as the
              gold standard threshold for species boundaries. The results
              indicate that the G+C content, if computed from genome sequences,
              varies no more than 1\% within species. Statistical models based
              on larger differences alone can reject the hypothesis that two
              strains belong to the same species. Because DDH similarities
              between two non-type strains occur in the genomic datasets, we
              also examine to what extent and under which conditions such a
              similarity could be <70\% even though the similarity of either
              strain to a type strain was $\geq$ 70\%. In theory, their
              similarity could be as low as 50\%, whereas empirical data
              suggest a boundary closer (but not identical) to 70\%. However,
              it is shown that using a 50\% boundary would not affect the
              conclusions regarding the DNA G+C content. Hence, we suggest that
              discrepancies between G+C content data provided in species
              descriptions on the one hand and those recalculated after genome
              sequencing on the other hand $\geq$ 1\% are due to significant

              taxonomy of bacteria and archaea as a substitute for the
              labour-intensive DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) technique. An ANI
              threshold range (95-96\%) for species demarcation had previously

              we investigated the overall distribution of ANI values generated
              by pairwise comparison of 6787 genomes of prokaryotes belonging
              to 22 phyla to see whether the suggested range can be applied to

  abstract = "DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values have been used by bacterial
              taxonomists since the 1960s to determine relatedness between
              strains and are still the most important criterion in the
              delineation of bacterial species. Since the extent of
              hybridization between a pair of strains is ultimately governed by
              their respective genomic sequences, we examined the quantitative
              relationship between DDH values and genome sequence-derived
              parameters, such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of
              common genes and the percentage of conserved DNA. A total of 124
              DDH values were determined for 28 strains for which genome
              sequences were available. The strains belong to six important and
              diverse groups of bacteria for which the intra-group 16S rRNA
              gene sequence identity was greater than 94 \%. The results
              revealed a close relationship between DDH values and ANI and
              between DNA-DNA hybridization and the percentage of conserved DNA
              for each pair of strains. The recommended cut-off point of 70 \%
              DDH for species delineation corresponded to 95 \% ANI and 69 \%
              conserved DNA. When the analysis was restricted to the
              protein-coding portion of the genome, 70 \% DDH corresponded to
              85 \% conserved genes for a pair of strains. These results reveal
              extensive gene diversity within the current concept of
              ``species''. Examination of reciprocal values indicated that the
              level of experimental error associated with the DDH method is too
              high to reveal the subtle differences in genome size among the
              strains sampled. It is concluded that ANI can accurately replace
              DDH values for strains for which genome sequences are available.",

              rRNA gene sequence analysis allocated the isolates to the family

              two distinct groups that represent two novel species, as
              confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridizations. The two novel species can be

              Draft genomes were approximately 4.9 Mb in size with a G+C

              Enterobacter xiangfangensis and Enterobacter hormaechei. These
              eight strains showed less than 70 \% isDDH identity with the type
              strains of Enterobacter species. In addition, less than 95 \% ANI

              processes such as disease emergence, long-term host-pathogen

              estimate these rates and reveal the factors that shape bacterial
              evolutionary dynamics. For many organisms estimates of
              evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the
              time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this
              relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty
              in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted
              by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the
              prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome
              sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to
              systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and
              assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of
              recombination. The majority (28/36) of data sets possessed
              sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary
              rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not
              possible even with 'ancient DNA' data sampled over many
              centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they
              display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly
              estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude,
              from approximately 10-5 to 10-8 nucleotide substitutions per site
              year-1. This variation was negatively associated with sampling
              time, with this relationship best described by an exponential
              decay curve. To avoid potential estimation biases, such

              sequences. We investigated the diversity of the capsule synthesis
              loci (K-loci) among 2503 K. pneumoniae genomes. We incorporated
              analyses of full-length K-locus nucleotide sequences and also
              clustered protein-encoding sequences to identify, annotate and
              compare K-locus structures. We propose a standardized

              Recently, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been

              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between isolates is the

              accuracy of downstream analyses, such as phylogenetic tree
              inference. In particular, when closely related isolates are
              analyzed, e.g. in outbreak investigations, some SNP callers tend
              to detect a high number of false-positive SNPs compared with the

              structured 5'UTRs containing replication and/or packaging
              signals. Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs
              are apparently monocistronic, RNA viruses must often express
              multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have
              very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to
              optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these
              features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical
              translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet
              these challenges. Here, we review the mechanisms utilized by RNA
              viruses of eukaryotes, focusing on internal ribosome entry, leaky
              scanning, non-AUG initiation, ribosome shunting, reinitiation,
              ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. The review

              translational strategies, besides revisiting some classical

  abstract = "Enormous databases of short-read RNA-seq sequencing experiments
              such as the NIH Sequence Read Archive (SRA) are now available.
              However, these collections remain difficult to use due to the
              inability to search for a particular expressed sequence. A
              natural question is which of these experiments contain sequences
              that indicate the expression of a particular sequence such as a
              gene isoform, lncRNA, or uORF. However, at present this is a
              computationally demanding question at the scale of these
              databases. We introduce an indexing scheme, the Sequence Bloom
              Tree (SBT), to support sequence-based querying of terabase-scale
              collections of thousands of short-read sequencing experiments. We
              apply SBT to the problem of finding conditions under which query
              transcripts are expressed. Our experiments are conducted on a set
              of 2652 publicly available RNA-seq experiments contained in the
              NIH for the breast, blood, and brain tissues, comprising 5
              terabytes of sequence. SBTs of this size can be queried for a
              1000 nt sequence in 19 minutes using less than 300 MB of RAM,
              over 100 times faster than standard usage of SRA-BLAST and 119
              times faster than STAR. SBTs allow for fast identification of
              experiments with expressed novel isoforms, even if these isoforms
              were unknown at the time the SBT was built. We also provide some
              theoretical guidance about appropriate parameter selection in SBT
              and propose a sampling-based scheme for potentially scaling SBT
              to even larger collections of files. While SBT can handle any set
              of reads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SBT by searching a
              large collection of blood, brain, and breast RNA-seq files for
              all 214,293 known human transcripts to identify tissue-specific

              Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach
              hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up
              established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for
              leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic datasets.
              Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and

              computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in
              computational biology. In this paper, we generalize existing

              As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we

              time), 2) buy-in (i.e., getting any data from a run), and 3)
              sample preparation. Although many researchers have focused on
              reducing sample preparation costs, few have addressed the first
              two problems. Here, we present iTru and iNext, dual-indexing
              systems for Illumina libraries that help address all three of
              these issues. By breaking the library construction process into
              re-usable, combinatorial components, we achieve low start-up,
              buy-in, and per-sample costs, while simultaneously increasing the
              number of samples that can be combined within a single run. We
              accomplish this by extending the Illumina TruSeq dual-indexing
              approach from 20 (8+12) indexed adapters that produce 96 (8x12)
              unique combinations to 579 (192+387) indexed primers that produce
              74,304 (192x387) unique combinations. We synthesized 208 of these
              indexed primers for validation, and 206 of them passed our
              validation criteria (99\% success). We also used the indexed
              primers to create hundreds of libraries in a variety of
              scenarios. Our approach reduces start-up and per-sample costs by
              requiring only one universal adapter which works with indexed PCR
              primers to uniquely identify samples. Our approach reduces buy-in
              costs because: 1) relatively few oligonucleotides are needed to
              produce a large number of indexed libraries; and 2) the large
              number of possible primers allows researchers to use unique
              primer sets for different projects, which facilitates pooling of
              samples during sequencing. Although the methods we present are
              highly customizable, resulting libraries can be used with the
              standard Illumina sequencing primers and demultiplexed with the

              those branches were in. Here we extend this approach and show
              that it can be applied to partially sampled and ongoing
              outbreaks. This requires computing the correct probability of an
              observed transmission tree and we herein demonstrate how to do
              this for a large class of epidemiological models. We also
              demonstrate how the branch colouring approach can incorporate a
              variable number of unique colours to represent unsampled
              intermediates in transmission chains. The resulting algorithm is
              a reversible jump Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, which we apply to
              both simulated data and real data from an outbreak of
              tuberculosis. By accounting for unsampled cases and an outbreak
              which may not have reached its end, our method is uniquely suited
              to use in a public health environment during real-time outbreak
              investigations. We implemented our technique in an R package

              from MetAgeNomes. Metagenome sequencing generates short reads
              from throughout the genomes of a microbial community.
              Increasingly large, multi-sample metagenomes, stratified in space
              and time are being generated from communities with thousands of
              species. Repeats result in fragmentary co-assemblies with
              potentially millions of contigs. Contigs can be binned into
              metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) but strain level variation
              will remain. DESMAN identifies variants on core genes, then uses
              co-occurrence across samples to link variants into strain
              sequences and abundance profiles. These strain profiles are then
              searched for on non-core genes to determine the accessory genes
              present in each strain. Results: We validated DESMAN on a
              synthetic twenty genome community with 64 samples. We could
              resolve the five E. coli strains present with 99.58\% accuracy
              across core gene variable sites and their gene complement with
              95.7\% accuracy. Similarly, on real fecal metagenomes from the
              2011 E. coli (STEC) O104:H4 outbreak, the outbreak strain was
              reconstructed with 99.8\% core sequence accuracy. Application to
              an anaerobic digester metagenome time series reveals that strain
              level variation is endemic with 16 out of 26 MAGs (61.5\%)
              examined exhibiting two strains. In almost all cases the strain
              proportions were not statistically different between replicate
              reactors, suggesting intra-species niche partitioning. The only
              exception being when the two strains had almost identical gene
              complement and, hence, functional capability. Conclusions: DESMAN
              will provide a provide a powerful tool for de novo resolution of
              fine-scale variation in microbial communities. It is available as

              microbial isolates. On the other hand, among massive numbers of
              Illumina sequencing reads produced, there is a slim chance of
              re-evaluating failed microbial genome assembly (high contig
              number, large total contig size, and/or the presence of low-depth
              contigs). We generated Illumina-type test datasets with various
              levels of sequencing error, pretreatment (trimming and error
              correction), repetitive sequences, contamination, and ploidy from
              both simulated and real sequencing data and applied k-mer
              abundance analysis to quickly detect possible diagnostic
              signatures of poor assemblies. Contamination was the only factor
              leading to poor assemblies for the test dataset derived from
              haploid microbial genomes, resulting in an extraordinary peak
              within low-frequency k-mer range. When thirteen Illumina
              sequencing reads of microbes belonging to genera Bacillus or
              Paenibacillus from a single multiplexed run were subjected to a
              k-mer abundance analysis, all three samples leading to poor
              assemblies showed peculiar patterns of contamination. Read depth
              distribution along the contig length indicated that all
              problematic assemblies suffered from too many contigs with low
              average read coverage, where 1\% to 15\% of total reads were
              mapped to low-coverage contigs. We found that subsampling or

              low-level contaminants and greatly improve the de novo
              assemblies. An analysis of 16S rRNA genes recruited from reads or
              contigs and the application of read classification tools
              originally designed for metagenome analyses can help identify the
              source of a contamination. The unexpected presence of

              order to reduce memory consumption and processing time. Although
              very useful, the minimizers selection procedure has undesirable
              behaviors (e.g., too many k-mers are selected when processing
              certain sequences). Some of these problems were already known to
              the authors of the minimizers technique, and the natural
              lexicographic ordering of k-mers used by minimizers was
              recognized as their origin. Many software tools using minimizers
              employ ad hoc variations of the lexicographic order to alleviate
              those issues. We provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of
              k-mer ordering on the performance of the minimizers technique. By
              using small universal hitting sets (a recently defined concept),
              we show how to significantly improve the performance of
              minimizers and avoid some of its worse behaviors. Based on these
              results, we encourage bioinformatics software developers to use
              an ordering based on a universal hitting set or, if not possible,
              a randomized ordering, rather than the lexicographic order. This
              analysis also settles negatively a conjecture (by Schleimer et
              al.) on the expected density of minimizers in a random sequence.",

              untapped biotechnological resource for biomining, biorefining and
              synthetic biology. Revealing this information requires the
              recovery of the exact sequence of DNA bases (or ``haplotype'')
              that constitutes the genes and genomes of every individual
              present. This is a computationally difficult problem complicated
              by the requirement for environmental sequencing approaches
              (metagenomics) due to the resistance of the constituent organisms
              to culturing in vitro. Haplotypes are identified by their unique
              combination of DNA variants. However, standard approaches for
              working with metagenomic data require simplifications that
              violate assumptions in the process of identifying such variation.
              Furthermore, current haplotyping methods lack objective
              mechanisms for choosing between alternative haplotype
              reconstructions from microbial communities. To address this, we
              have developed a novel probabilistic approach for reconstructing
              haplotypes from complex microbial communities and propose the
              ``metahaplome'' as a definition for the set of haplotypes for any
              particular genomic region of interest within a metagenomic
              dataset. Implemented in the twin software tools Hansel and
              Gretel, the algorithm performs incremental probabilistic
              haplotype recovery using Naive Bayes - an efficient and effective
              technique. Our approach is capable of reconstructing the
              haplotypes with the highest likelihoods from metagenomic datasets
              without a priori knowledge or making assumptions of the
              distribution or number of variants. Additionally, the algorithm
              is robust to sequencing and alignment error without altering or
              discarding observed variation and uses all available evidence
              from aligned reads. We validate our approach using synthetic
              metahaplomes constructed from sets of real genes, and demonstrate
              its capability using metagenomic data from a complex HIV-1 strain
              mix. The results show that the likelihood framework can allow

              contain most salient information needed for assembly, and
              demonstrate they enable cleaning of metagenome assembly graphs,

              flexibility has not yet been reached. Among the flexible
              plate-based methods ``Single-Cell RNA-Barcoding and Sequencing''
              (SCRB-seq) is one of the most sensitive and efficient ones. Based
              on this protocol, we systematically evaluated experimental
              conditions such as reverse transcriptases, reaction enhancers and
              PCR polymerases. We find that adding polyethylene glycol
              considerably increases sensitivity by enhancing cDNA synthesis.
              Furthermore, using Terra polymerase increases efficiency due to a
              more even cDNA amplification that requires less sequencing of
              libraries. We combined these and other improvements to a new
              scRNA-seq library protocol we call ``molecular crowding
              SCRB-seq'' (mcSCRB-seq), which we show to be the most sensitive
              and one of the most efficient and flexible scRNA-seq methods to

              involved in the carriage of clinically important genes (e.g.
              those involved in AMR/virulence). The widespread application of
              this technique is currently primarily limited by cost. Recent
              data has suggested that non-inferior, and even superior, hybrid
              assemblies can be produced using a fraction of the total output
              from a multiplexed nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT])

              minimal running time for flowcells when acquiring reads for
              hybrid assembly. We then evaluated whether the ONT wash kit might
              allow users to exploit shorter running times by sequencing
              multiple libraries per flowcell. After 24 hours of sequencing,
              most chromosomes and plasmids had circularised and there was no
              benefit associated with longer running times. Quality was similar
              at 12 hours suggesting shorter running times are likely to be
              acceptable for certain applications (e.g. plasmid genomics). The
              ONT wash kit was highly effective in removing DNA between
              libraries. Contamination between libraries did not appear to
              affect subsequent hybrid assemblies, even when the same barcodes
              were used successively on a single flowcell. Utilising shorter
              run-times in combination with between-library nuclease washes
              allows at least 36 Enterobacteriaceae isolates to be sequenced
              per flowcell, significantly reducing the per isolate sequencing
              cost. Ultimately this will facilitate large-scale studies

              filter-based indexes and variants, such as the Sequence Bloom
              Tree, have been proposed in the past to solve this problem.
              However, these approaches suffer from fundamental limitations of
              the Bloom filter, resulting in slow build and query times,
              less-than-optimal space usage, and large numbers of false
              positives. Results: This paper introduces Mantis, a
              space-efficient data structure that can be used to index
              thousands of raw-read experiments and facilitate large-scale
              sequence searches on those experiments. Mantis uses counting
              quotient filters instead of Bloom filters, enabling rapid index
              builds and queries, small indexes, and exact results, i.e., no
              false positives or negatives. Furthermore, Mantis is also a
              colored de Bruijn graph representation, so it supports fast graph
              traversal and other topological analyses in addition to
              large-scale sequence-level searches. In our performance
              evaluation, index construction with Mantis is 4.4x faster and
              yields a 20\% smaller index than the state-of-the-art split

              and clinical isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing
              and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results. K. pneumoniae
              throat carriage prevalence was 4.1\%, rectal carriage 10.8\% and
              ESBL carriage 1.7\%. K. pneumoniae infection incidence was 1.2\%.
              The isolates were diverse, and most patients were colonized or
              infected with a unique phylogenetic lineage, with no evidence of
              transmission in the wards. ESBL strains carried blaCTX-M-15 and
              belonged to clones associated with hospital-acquired ESBL
              infections in other countries (ST29, ST323, ST340). One also
              carried the carbapenemase blaIMP-26. Genomic and epidemiological
              data provided evidence that ESBL strains were acquired in the
              referring hospital. Nanopore sequencing also identified
              strain-to-strain transmission of a blaCTX-M-15 FIBK/FIIK plasmid
              in the referring hospital. Conclusions. The data suggest the
              major source of K. pneumoniae was the patient9s own gut
              microbiome, but ESBL strains were acquired in the referring
              hospital. This highlights the importance of the wider hospital
              network to understanding K. pneumoniae risk and infection
              control. Rectal screening for ESBL organisms upon admission to
              geriatric wards could help inform patient management and
              infection control in such facilities.",

  abstract = "Only a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in
              regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this
              portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with
              diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this
              is an especially challenging problem. While regulatory regions
              are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and
              sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be
              identified. We developed a computational framework to exploit
              this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify
              regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do
              this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural
              language processing: (1) ``bag-of-words'' which is commonly used
              for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment
              analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec
              (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic
              relationships between words. We built ``bag-of-k-mers'' and
              ``vector-k-mers'' models that distinguish between regulatory and
              non-regulatory regions with an accuracy above 90\%. Our
              ``bag-of-k-mers'' achieved higher overall accuracy, while the
              ``vector-k-mers'' models were more useful in highlighting key
              groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models
              now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in
              other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high

  abstract = "K-mer profiling has been one of the trending approaches to
              analyze read data generated by high-throughput sequencing
              technologies. The tasks of k-mer profiling include, but are not
              limited to, counting the frequencies and determining the
              occurrences of short sequences in a dataset. The notion of k-mer
              has been extensively used to build de Bruijn graphs in genome or
              transcriptome assembly, which requires examining all possible
              k-mers presented in the dataset. Recently, an alternative way of
              profiling has been proposed, which constructs a set of
              representative k-mers as genomic markers and profiles their
              occurrences in the sequencing data. This technique has been
              applied in both transcript quantification through RNA-Seq and
              taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads. Most of these
              applications use a set of fixed-size k-mers since the majority of
              existing k-mer counters are inadequate to process genomic
              sequences with variable-length k-mers. However, choosing the
              appropriate k is challenging, as it varies for different
              applications. As a pioneer work to profile a set of
              variable-length k-mers, we propose TahcoRoll in order to enhance
              the Aho-Corasick algorithm. More specifically, we use one bit to
              represent each nucleotide, and integrate the rolling hash
              technique to construct an efficient in-memory data structure for
              this task. Using both synthetic and real datasets, results show
              that TahcoRoll outperforms existing approaches in either or both
              time and memory efficiency without using any disk space. In
              addition, compared to the most efficient state-of-the-art k-mer
              counters, such as KMC and MSBWT, TahcoRoll is the only approach

  abstract = "The problem of genome assembly is ultimately linked to the
              problem of the characterization of all repeat families in a
              genome as a repeat graph. The key reason the de Bruijn graph
              emerged as a popular short read assembly approach is because it
              offered an elegant representation of all repeats in a genome that
              reveals their mosaic structure. However, most algorithms for
              assembling long error-prone reads use an alternative
              overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) approach that does not provide a
              repeat characterization. We present the Flye algorithm for
              constructing the A-Bruijn (assembly) graph from long error-prone
              reads, that, in contrast to the k-mer-based de Bruijn graph,
              assembles genomes using an alignment-based A-Bruijn graph. In
              difference from existing assemblers, Flye does not attempt to
              construct accurate contigs (at least at the initial assembly
              stage) but instead simply generates arbitrary paths in the
              (unknown) assembly graph and further constructs an assembly graph
              from these paths. Counter-intuitively, this fast but seemingly
              reckless approach results in the same graph as the assembly graph
              constructed from accurate contigs. Flye constructs (overlapping)
              contigs with possible assembly errors at the initial stage,
              combines them into an accurate assembly graph, resolves repeats
              in the assembly graph using small variations between various
              repeat instances that were left unresolved during the initial
              assembly stage, constructs a new, less tangled assembly graph
              based on resolved repeats, and finally outputs accurate contigs
              as paths in this graph. We benchmark Flye against several
              state-of-the-art Single Molecule Sequencing assemblers and

              different environments or host phenotypes. The most common and
              cost-effective approach for such studies to date is 16S rRNA gene
              sequencing. Recent falls in sequencing costs have increased the
              demand for simple, efficient, and accurate methods for rapid
              detection or diagnosis with proved applications in medicine,
              agriculture, and forensic science. Results: We describe a
              reference- and alignment-free approach for predicting the
              environment or host phenotype from microbial community samples
              based on k-mer distributions in 16S rRNA data. In addition, we
              propose a bootstrapping framework to investigate the sufficiency
              of a shallow sub-sample for prediction. We study the use of deep
              learning methods as well as classic machine learning approaches
              for distinguishing among human body-sites, diagnosis of Crohn9s
              disease, and predicting the environments (18 ecological and 5
              organismal environments) from representative 16S gene sequences.
              Furthermore, we explore the use of unsupervised dimensionality
              reduction methods as well as supervised deep representation
              learning for visualizing microbial data of different environments
              and host phenotypes. We demonstrated that k-mer representations
              outperform Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) features in
              distinguishing among 5 major body-sites, as well as predicting
              Crohn9s disease using 16S rRNA sequencing samples. We also showed
              that a shallow sub-sample of 16S rRNA samples alone can be
              sufficient to produce a proper k-mer representation of data.
              Aside from being more accurate, using k-mer features in shallow
              sub-samples provided the following benefits: (i) skipping
              computationally costly sequence alignments required in
              OTU-picking, and (ii) proof of concept for the sufficiency of a
              shallow and short-length 16S rRNA sequencing for environment/host
              phenotype prediction. In addition, k-mer features were able to

              exists no cost-effective method for precisely characterizing
              species and genes present in such communities. While deep
              whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing provides the highest-level
              of taxonomic and functional resolution, it is often prohibitively
              expensive for large-scale studies. The prevailing alternative,
              high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S), often
              does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level and provides only
              moderately accurate predictions of the functional profile; thus,
              there is currently no widely accepted approach to affordable,
              high-resolution, taxonomic and functional microbiome analysis. To
              address this technology gap, we evaluated the information content
              of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low as 0.5 million
              sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S sequencing for
              large human microbiome studies. We describe a library preparation
              protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing at approximately the
              same per-sample cost as 16S. We analyzed multiple real and
              simulated biological data sets, including two novel human stool
              samples with ultra-deep sequencing of 2.5 billion sequences per
              sample, and found that shallow shotgun recovers accurate
              species-level taxonomic and functional profiles of the human
              microbiome. We recognize and discuss some of the inherent
              limitations of shallow shotgun sequencing, and note that 16S
              sequencing remains a valuable and important method for taxonomic
              profiling of novel environments. Although deep WGS remains the
              gold standard for high-resolution microbiome analysis, we
              recommend that researchers consider shallow shotgun sequencing as
              a useful alternative to 16S for large-scale human microbiome

              caused by hypervirulent clones that rarely harbour acquired AMR

              the last few years have seen increasing reports of convergence of

              it is not yet clear whether these represent a transient

              comparative genomic analyses for 28 distinct Kp clones, including
              6 hypervirulent and 8 MDR, to better understand their

              closely related viruses that are generally referred to as
              quasispecies. Although standard (short-read) sequencing
              technologies allow to readily determine consensus sequences for
              these quasispecies, it is far more difficult to reconstruct large

              (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome
              regions that may be present in these virus populations. Here, we
              used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach without
              any amplification step to characterize viral RNAs produced in
              cells infected with a human coronavirus representing one of the
              largest RNA virus genomes known to date. Using DRS, we were able

              reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing,
              a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus
              (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb) was reconstructed. Furthermore,
              using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were
              able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E

              they often need input in the form of low-dimensional, dense
              vectors of numbers. We propose such a representation for genomes
              called nanotext that scales to very large data sets.The
              underlying model is learned from a corpus of nearly 150 thousand
              genomes spanning 750 million protein domains. We treat the
              protein domains in a genome like words in a document, assuming
              that protein domains in a similar context have similar
              ``meaning''. This meaning can be distributed by a neural net over
              a vector of numbers.The resulting vectors efficiently encode
              function, preserve known phylogeny, capture subtle functional
              relationships and are robust against genome incompleteness. The
              ``functional'' distance between two vectors complements
              nucleotide-based distance, so that genomes can be identified as
              similar even though their nucleotide identity is low. nanotext
              can thus encode (meta)genomes for direct use in downstream

  abstract = "Motivation Zoonosis, the natural transmission of infections from
              animals to humans, is a far-reaching global problem. The recent
              outbreaks of Zika virus, Ebola virus and Corona virus are
              examples of viral zoonosis, which occur more frequently due to
              globalization. In the case of a virus outbreak, it is helpful to
              know which host organism was the original carrier of the virus.
              Once the reservoir or intermediate host is known, it can be
              isolated to prevent further spreading of the viral infection.
              Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral
              genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and
              arbitrarily selected features. These methods have a clear
              limitation in either the number of different hosts they can
              predict or the accuracy of their prediction. Results Here, we
              present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host
              prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. To
              ensure a high prediction accuracy, we developed an effective
              selection approach for the training data to avoid biases due to a
              highly unbalanced number of known sequences per virus-host
              combinations. We tested our deep neural network on three
              different virus species (influenza A, rabies lyssavirus,
              rotavirus A). We reached for each virus species an AUG between
              0.93 and 0.98, outperforming previous approaches and allowing
              highly accurate predictions while only using fractions (100-400
              bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural
              networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a
              limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data.
              The deep neural networks trained for this approach build the core
              of the virus-host predicting tool VIDHOP (Virus Deep learning

              global public health crisis. Bacteriophage therapy (or ``phage
              therapy'') is a potential alternative approach to treat MDR
              infections. However, the effective use of phage therapy may be
              limited when phage-resistant bacterial mutants evolve and
              proliferate during treatment. Here, we develop a nonlinear

              for the interactions between bacteria, phage and antibiotics for
              in-vivo application given an immune response against bacteria. We

              evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic
              (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires
              choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to,
              which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the
              accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained.This
              study evaluates the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines using
              simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria
              and real data from environmentally-sourced and genomically
              diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter,

              of 41 SNP calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the
              same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal
              determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome
              selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse
              relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the

              critical task of improving the quality of reference indices to
              which metagenomic reads are assigned. Here, we inferred the
              taxonomic composition of 404 publicly available metagenomes from
              human, marine and soil environments, using custom index databases
              modified according to two factors: the number of reference
              genomes used to build the databases, and the monophyletic
              strictness of species definitions. Index databases built
              following the NCBI taxonomic system were also compared to others

              genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures and
              the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion.
              However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates
              precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial
              life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to
              initially as community genomics and subsequently as
              genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by
              obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), but gaps, local
              assembly errors, chimeras and contamination by fragments from
              other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss

              pathogens and model organisms. Thus many genomes contain little
              additional information and could be removed. We created a frugal
              dereplication method that can reduce massive genome collections
              based on genome sequence alone, without the need for manual
              curation nor taxonomic information.We recently created a genome

              Extending nanotext, our proposed algorithm called ``thinspace''

              dereplicated the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) from about 150

              <200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for

              assemblies with vastly greater contiguity than those based on
              Sanger, Illumina, or other technologies. However, the very high
              error rates of these two new technologies (∼15\% per base) makes
              assembly imprecise at repeats longer than the read length and

              quality of the assembly of these noisy long reads can be
              significantly improved at a minimal cost, by leveraging on the
              low error rate and low cost of Illumina short reads. Namely,
              k-mers from the PacBio raw reads that are not present in Illumina
              reads (which account for ∼95\% of the distinct k-mers) are deemed

              Aggressive approaches to repeat resolution often produce

              accomplished by adding ``hinges'' to reads for constructing an
              overlap graph where only unresolvable repeats are merged. As a

              peptides for prokaryotes, close to 95\% of the identifiable

               diverse than originally thought. To date, this diversity has
               largely been uncovered using short-read whole-genome sequencing.
               However, these short-read approaches fail to give a complete
               picture of a genome. They struggle to identify structural
               events, cannot access repetitive regions, and fail to resolve
               the human genome into haplotypes. Here, we describe an approach
               that retains long range information while maintaining the
               advantages of short reads. Starting from ∼1 ng of high molecular
               weight DNA, we produce barcoded short-read libraries. Novel
               informatic approaches allow for the barcoded short reads to be
               associated with their original long molecules producing a novel
               data type known as ``Linked-Reads''. This approach allows for
               simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single
               library. In this manuscript, we show the advantages of
               Linked-Reads over standard short-read approaches for
               reference-based analysis. Linked-Reads allow mapping to 38 Mb of
               sequence not accessible to short reads, adding sequence in 423

              widespread species. Connections between closely related isolates

  abstract = "Repeat families within genomes are often maintained with similar
              sequences. Traditionally, this has been explained by concerted
              evolution, where repeats in an array evolve ``in concert'' with
              the same sequence via continual turnover of repeats by
              recombination. Another form of evolution, birth-and-death
              evolution, can also explain this pattern, although in this case
              selection is the critical force maintaining the repeats. The
              level of intragenomic variation is the key difference between
              these two forms of evolution. The prohibitive size and repetitive
              nature of large repeat arrays have made determination of the
              absolute level of intragenomic repeat variability difficult, thus
              there is little evidence to support concerted evolution over
              birth-and-death evolution for many large repeat arrays. Here we
              use whole-genome shotgun sequence data from the genome projects
              of five fungal species to reveal absolute levels of sequence
              variation within the ribosomal RNA gene repeats (rDNA). The level
              of sequence variation is remarkably low. Furthermore, the
              polymorphisms that are detected are not functionally constrained
              and seem to exist beneath the level of selection. These results
              suggest the rDNA is evolving via concerted evolution. Comparisons
              with a repeat array undergoing birth-and-death evolution provide
              a clear contrast in the level of repeat array variation between
              these two forms of evolution, confirming that the rDNA indeed
              does evolve via concerted evolution. These low levels of
              intra-genomic variation are consistent with a model of concerted
              evolution in which homogenization is very rapid and efficiently

              microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is
              usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of
              known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of
              paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and
              BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging
              sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput
              are paving the way to low-cost random ``shotgun'' approaches.
              This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows
              laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a
              preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against
              databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison
              tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical
              content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize
              and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm
              assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the
              assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the
              sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected

              analysis. However, it remains unclear whether these tests are
              reliable. * We investigate the performance of several tests of
              temporal signal, including some recently suggested modifications.
              We use simulated data (where the true evolutionary history is
              known), and whole genomes of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (to show how particular problems arise with real-world
              data sets). * We show that all of the standard tests of temporal
              signal are seriously misleading for data where temporal and
              genetic structures are confounded (i.e. where closely related
              sequences are more likely to have been sampled at similar times).
              This is not an artefact of genetic structure or tree shape per
              se, and can arise even when sequences have measurably evolved
              during the sampling period. More positively, we show that a
              `clustered permutation' approach introduced by Duch{\^e}ne et al.
              (Molecular Biology and Evolution, 32, 2015, 1895) can
              successfully correct for this artefact in all cases and introduce
              techniques for implementing this method with real data sets. *
              The confounding of temporal and genetic structures may be
              difficult to avoid in practice, particularly for outbreaks of
              infectious disease, or when using ancient DNA. Therefore, we
              recommend the use of `clustered permutation' for all analyses.
              The failure of the standard tests may explain why different

  abstract = "* Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand
              ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is
              often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such
              as the widely used BUGS family (BUGS, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and
              JAGS). However, some models have prohibitively long run times
              when implemented in BUGS. A relatively new software platform
              called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), a family of
              Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms which promise improved
              efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by BUGS.
              Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to
              BUGS, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part
              to the complex nature of HMC. * Here, we provide an intuitive
              illustration of the principles of HMC on a set of simple models.
              We then compared the relative efficiency of BUGS and Stan using
              population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For
              hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an
              alternative parameterization of random effects, known as
              non-centering. * For small, simple models there is little
              practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan
              outperforms BUGS as model size and complexity grows. Stan also
              performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to
              model parameterization than BUGS. Stan may also be more robust to
              biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces
              diagnostic warnings where BUGS provides none. Disadvantages of
              Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more
              complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on
              tuning. * Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many
              ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for
              problems where BUGS is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can
              extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems,
              leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields
              that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and

  abstract  = "Ecological data often show temporal, spatial, hierarchical
               (random effects), or phylogenetic structure. Modern statistical
               approaches are increasingly accounting for such dependencies.
               However, when performing cross-validation, these structures are
               regularly ignored, resulting in serious underestimation of
               predictive error. One cause for the poor performance of
               uncorrected (random) cross-validation, noted often by modellers,
               are dependence structures in the data that persist as dependence
               structures in model residuals, violating the assumption of
               independence. Even more concerning, because often overlooked, is
               that structured data also provides ample opportunity for
               overfitting with non-causal predictors. This problem can persist
               even if remedies such as autoregressive models, generalized
               least squares, or mixed models are used. Block cross-validation,
               where data are split strategically rather than randomly, can
               address these issues. However, the blocking strategy must be
               carefully considered. Blocking in space, time, random effects or
               phylogenetic distance, while accounting for dependencies in the
               data, may also unwittingly induce extrapolations by restricting
               the ranges or combinations of predictor variables available for
               model training, thus overestimating interpolation errors. On the
               other hand, deliberate blocking in predictor space may also
               improve error estimates when extrapolation is the modelling
               goal. Here, we review the ecological literature on non-random
               and blocked cross-validation approaches. We also provide a
               series of simulations and case studies, in which we show that,
               for all instances tested, block cross-validation is nearly
               universally more appropriate than random cross-validation if the
               goal is predicting to new data or predictor space, or for
               selecting causal predictors. We recommend that block
               cross-validation be used wherever dependence structures exist in
               a dataset, even if no correlation structure is visible in the
               fitted model residuals, or if the fitted models account for such
               correlations.",

              Rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing technology and the
              simultaneous development of bioinformatic tools have democratized
              the field. It is now within reach for individual research groups
              in the eco-evolutionary and conservation community to generate de
              novo draft genome sequences for any organism of choice. Because
              of the cost and considerable effort involved in such an

              whether a genome sequence is necessary for addressing the

              incomplete. Here, we explore the evolution of Marek's disease
              virus (MDV), a herpesvirus commonly afflicting chickens and
              rarely other avian species. The history of MDV in the 20th
              century represents an important case study in the evolution of
              virulence. The severity of MDV infection in chickens has been
              rising steadily since the adoption of intensive farming
              techniques and vaccination programs in the 1950s and 1970s,
              respectively. It has remained uncertain, however, which of these
              factors is causally more responsible for the observed increase in
              virulence of circulating viruses. We conducted a phylogenomic
              study to understand the evolution of MDV in the context of
              dramatic changes to poultry farming and disease control. Our
              analysis reveals evidence of geographical structuring of MDV
              strains, with reconstructions supporting the emergence of
              virulent viruses independently in North America and Eurasia. Of
              note, the emergence of virulent viruses appears to coincide
              approximately with the introduction of comprehensive vaccination
              on both continents. The time-dated phylogeny also indicated that
              MDV has a mean evolutionary rate of ~1.6 $\times$ 10(-5)
              substitutions per site per year. An examination of gene-linked
              mutations did not identify a strong association between
              mutational variation and virulence phenotypes, indicating that
              MDV may evolve readily and rapidly under strong selective
              pressures and that multiple genotypic pathways may underlie
              virulence adaptation in MDV.",

               transmissible by seed, increasing the fear of long-distance
               spread of the disease. In the late 1970s, it was claimed on the
               basis of biological transmission of the virus to herbaceous
               indicator plants and the development of serological diagnosis
               based on polyclonal antibodies, that PPV was seed-transmitted,
               with a different infection rate according to the plant species
               and part of the seed which was tested. In the 1990s, PPV was
               characterized into four different types, and specific monoclonal
               antibodies were produced for them. These new and more sensitive
               diagnostic techniques, together with RT-PCR with different sets
               of specific primers, were used to approach once again the
               problem of PPV transmission through seeds. The virus was
               detected in seed coats and cotyledons, but embryonic tissue and
               seedlings obtained from germinated seeds never showed symptoms,
               and gave negative results for PPV with both ELISA and PCR
               assays. No PPV isolate is currently recognized to be seed
               transmitted, so vertical transmission of PPV from infected
               mother plants to their progeny does not occur. Hypothetically,

              prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to
              express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities
              and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to
              boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting
              statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional
              techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted
              regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms:
              regression trees (models that relate a response to their
              predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive
              method for combining many simple models to give improved
              predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as
              an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple
              trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted
              regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based
              methods, handling different types of predictor variables and
              accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data
              transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex
              nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction
              effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT
              overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their
              relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are
              complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful
              ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior
              to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of
              BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We
              demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT
              through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel
              (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New
              Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate
              effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model
              using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to
              enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.",

              DNA (rDNA) to establish the identity and relationships among
              organisms, but the use of rRNA sequences can be problematic as
              the result of alignment ambiguities caused by indels, the lack of
              informative characters, and varying functional constraints over
              the molecule. Although protein-coding regions have been used as
              an alternative to rRNA, there is neither consensus among the
              genes examined nor ways to rapidly obtain sequence information
              for such genes from uncharacterized bacterial species. To
              standardize the set of protein-coding loci assayed in bacterial
              genomes, we examined over 100 widely distributed genes to
              identify sets of universal primers for use in the PCR
              amplification of protein coding regions that are common to
              virtually all bacteria. From this set, we developed primer sets

              locations and functional categories. Although many of the primers
              contain sequence degeneracies that aid in targeting genes across

              amplification products, thereby eliminating intermediate cloning

  abstract = "The emergence of mutations in nucleic acids is one of the major
              factors underlying evolution, providing the working material for
              natural selection. Most bacteria are haploid for the vast
              majority of their genes and, coupled with typically short
              generation times, this allows mutations to emerge and accumulate
              rapidly, and to effect significant phenotypic changes in what is
              perceived to be real-time. Not least among these phenotypic
              changes are those associated with antibiotic resistance.
              Mechanisms of horizontal gene spread among bacterial strains or
              species are often considered to be the main mediators of
              antibiotic resistance. However, mutational resistance has been
              invaluable in studies of bacterial genetics, and also has primary
              clinical importance in certain bacterial species, such as
              Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori, or when
              considering resistance to particular antibiotics, especially to
              synthetic agents such as fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones. In
              addition, mutation is essential for the continued evolution of
              acquired resistance genes and has, e.g., given rise to over 100
              variants of the TEM family of beta-lactamases. Hypermutator
              strains of bacteria, which have mutations in genes affecting DNA
              repair and replication fidelity, have elevated mutation rates.
              Mutational resistance emerges de novo more readily in these
              hypermutable strains, and they also provide a suitable host
              background for the evolution of acquired resistance genes in
              vitro. In the clinical setting, hypermutator strains of
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from the lungs of
              cystic fibrosis patients, but a more general role for
              hypermutators in the emergence of clinically relevant antibiotic

              worse, despite the ever-increasing resources devoted to combat
              the problem. One of the most important factors in the development
              of resistance to antibiotics is the remarkable ability of
              bacteria to share genetic resources via Lateral Gene Transfer
              (LGT). LGT occurs on a global scale, such that in theory, any

              mobilized and spread. With sufficiently strong selection, any

              presence. From an antibiotic resistance perspective, this means

              infections around the globe nearly simultaneously. We discuss the

              conditions and techniques of DNA extraction for Microsporum
              canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. verrucosum. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: Samples were prepared of each of the DNA extraction
              methods (phenol-chloroform, CTAB and four different kits) for all
              of the incubation periods (4, 7 and 10 days) of the cultures on
              the solid and in the liquid medium. The highest DNA
              concentrations were obtained using the phenol-chloroform method.
              The concentration of DNA extracted with the CTAB method accounted
              for 62·21\%, for kits it corresponded from 35·53 to 15·41\%. The
              analysis of the DNA weight yield revealed the highest isolation
              efficiency of the phenol-chloroform method, 1 mg of mycelium
              yielded 223·8 $\mu$g DNA. Lower DNA yield (by 39·32\%) was
              obtained with the CTAB method; in the case of kits by
              68·46-85·32\%. In most of the techniques, the DNA yield on the
              solid medium was higher. CONCLUSION: In summary, the highest DNA
              yield was noted in the 7-day cultures and extraction with the
              phenol-chloroform method. Importantly, the type of culture was
              not relevant for the diagnostic result. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT
              OF THE STUDY: Most mycoses are caused by fungi that reside in
              nature. The severity of the infection depends on the pathogenic
              attributes, socioeconomic factors and local environmental
              conditions. Recent diagnosis increasingly relies on not only the
              clinical features. Molecular identifications have determined the
              need for a rapid and easy method of extracting DNA. Usually two
              factors have to be considered: maximize the DNA yield and ensure
              that the extracted DNA is susceptible to enzymatic reactions.
              These data suggest that phenol-chloroform methods and a 7-day
              culture period may be useful for validation and constitute the
              first step of molecular diagnosis of dermatophytes.",

              components of the plant cell wall. Polysaccharide Utilization
              Loci (PULs) consist of gene clusters encoding different proteins
              with a vast arsenal of functions, including carbohydrate binding,
              transport and hydrolysis. Transport is often attributed to
              TonB-dependent transporters, although major facilitator
              superfamily (MFS) transporters have also been identified in some
              PULs. However, until now, few of these transporters have been
              biochemically characterized. Here, we targeted a PUL-like system

  abstract = "TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS: Plum pox virus (PPV) is a member of the
              genus Potyvirus in the family Potyviridae. PPV diversity is
              structured into at least eight monophyletic strains. GEOGRAPHICAL
              DISTRIBUTION: First discovered in Bulgaria, PPV is nowadays
              present in most of continental Europe (with an endemic status in
              many central and southern European countries) and has
              progressively spread to many countries on other continents.
              GENOMIC STRUCTURE: Typical of potyviruses, the PPV genome is a
              positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), with a protein linked
              to its 5' end and a 3'-terminal poly A tail. It is encapsidated
              by a single type of capsid protein (CP) in flexuous rod particles
              and is translated into a large polyprotein which is
              proteolytically processed in at least 10 final products: P1,
              HCPro, P3, 6K1, CI, 6K2, VPg, NIapro, NIb and CP. In addition,
              P3N-PIPO is predicted to be produced by a translational
              frameshift. PATHOGENICITY FEATURES: PPV causes sharka, the most
              damaging viral disease of stone fruit trees. It also infects wild
              and ornamental Prunus trees and has a large experimental host
              range in herbaceous species. PPV spreads over long distances by
              uncontrolled movement of plant material, and many species of
              aphid transmit the virus locally in a nonpersistent manner.
              SOURCES OF RESISTANCE: A few natural sources of resistance to PPV
              have been found so far in Prunus species, which are being used in
              classical breeding programmes. Different genetic engineering
              approaches are being used to generate resistance to PPV, and a
              transgenic plum, 'HoneySweet', transformed with the viral CP
              gene, has demonstrated high resistance to PPV in field tests in
              several countries and has obtained regulatory approval in the
              USA.",

              detected in Brazil in May 2015, and cases of microcephaly
              potentially associated with ZIKV infection were identified in
              November 2015. We performed next-generation sequencing to
              generate seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four
              self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and
              one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations.
              Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a
              single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated
              to have occurred between May and December 2013, more than 12
              months before the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date
              of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil
              from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks in
              the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are
              phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South

              best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy,
              although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our
              genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil
              provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and

               Kim). Candidate immune systems were then experimentally
               validated for their activities. Like well-known defense arsenals
               such as restriction-modification and CRISPR systems, these
               additional immune systems now require mechanistic investigation
               and could potentially be engineered into useful molecular tools
               in the future. Science , this issue p. [eaar4120][1]; see also
               p. [993][2] \#\#\# INTRODUCTION Bacteria and archaea are
               frequently attacked by viruses (phages) and as a result have
               developed multiple, sophisticated lines of active defense that
               can collectively be referred to as the prokaryotic ``immune
               system.'' Although bacterial defense against phages has been
               studied for decades, it was suggested that many currently
               unknown defense systems reside in the genomes of nonmodel
               bacteria and archaea and await discovery. \#\#\# RATIONALE
               Antiphage defense systems are known to be frequently physically
               clustered in microbial genomes such that, for example, genes
               encoding restriction enzymes commonly reside in the vicinity of
               genes encoding other phage resistance systems. The observation
               that defense systems are clustered in genomic ``defense
               islands'' has led to the hypothesis that genes of unknown
               function residing within such defense islands may also
               participate in antiphage defense. In this study, we aimed to
               comprehensively identify and experimentally verify new defense
               systems based on their enrichment within defense islands in an
               attempt to systematically map the arsenal of defense tools that
               are at the disposal of microbes in their fight against phages.
               \#\#\# RESULTS We searched for gene cassettes of unknown
               function that are enriched near known defense systems in more
               than 45,000 available bacterial and archaeal genome sequences.
               Such gene cassettes were defined as candidate defense systems
               and were systematically engineered into model bacteria, which
               were then infected by an array of phages to test for antiphage
               activities. This yielded the discovery of nine new families of
               antiphage defense systems and one additional family of
               antiplasmid systems that are widespread in microbes and shown to
               strongly protect against foreign DNA invasion. The systems
               discovered include ones that seem to have adopted components of
               the bacterial flagella and chromosome maintenance complexes and
               use these components for defensive capacities. Our data also
               show that genes with Toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) domains are
               involved in bacterial defense against phages, providing evidence
               for a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components
               shared between animals, plants, and bacteria. \#\#\# CONCLUSIONS
               Our study expands the known arsenal of defense systems used by
               prokaryotes for protection against phages, exposing tens of
               thousands of instances of defense systems that were so far
               unknown. Some of these systems appear to employ completely new
               mechanisms of defense against phages. In the past, the discovery
               and mechanistic understanding of antiphage defense systems led
               to the development of important biotechnological tools, as
               exemplified by the use of restriction enzymes and CRISPR-Cas for
               biotechnological and biomedical applications. One may envision
               that some of the systems discovered in the current study, once
               their mechanism is deciphered, will also be adapted into useful
               molecular tools in the future. ![Figure][3] A pipeline for
               systematic discovery of defense systems. Microbial genomes (more
               than 45,000 in the current study) are mined for genetic systems
               that are physically enriched next to known defense systems such
               as restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas. Candidate predicted
               systems are cloned into model bacteria, and these bacteria are
               then infected by an array of phages from various families to
               determine whether they provide defense. The arms race between
               bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated
               antiphage defense systems, including CRISPR-Cas and
               restriction-modification systems. Evidence suggests that known
               and unknown defense systems are located in ``defense islands''
               in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the
               bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are
               clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes.
               Candidate defense systems were systematically engineered and
               validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We
               report nine previously unknown antiphage systems and one
               antiplasmid system that are widespread in microbes and strongly
               protect against foreign invaders. These include systems that
               adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin
               complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of
               innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and
               bacteria. [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aar4120 [2]:

              fluoroquinolone resistance-encoding, and aminoglycoside-modifying

              and acquired a urinary tract infection caused by a
              carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain that typed to
              the sequence type 14 complex. The isolate, Klebsiella pneumoniae
              05-506, was shown to possess a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) but
              was negative for previously known MBL genes. Gene libraries and
              amplification of class 1 integrons revealed three
              resistance-conferring regions; the first contained bla(CMY-4)
              flanked by ISEcP1 and blc. The second region of 4.8 kb contained
              a complex class 1 integron with the gene cassettes arr-2, a new
              erythromycin esterase gene; ereC; aadA1; and cmlA7. An intact
              ISCR1 element was shown to be downstream from the qac/sul genes.
              The third region consisted of a new MBL gene, designated
              bla(NDM-1), flanked on one side by K. pneumoniae DNA and a
              truncated IS26 element on its other side. The last two regions
              lie adjacent to one another, and all three regions are found on a
              180-kb region that is easily transferable to recipient strains
              and that confers resistance to all antibiotics except
              fluoroquinolones and colistin. NDM-1 shares very little identity
              with other MBLs, with the most similar MBLs being VIM-1/VIM-2,
              with which it has only 32.4\% identity. As well as possessing
              unique residues near the active site, NDM-1 also has an
              additional insert between positions 162 and 166 not present in
              other MBLs. NDM-1 has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, is monomeric,
              and can hydrolyze all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Compared to
              VIM-2, NDM-1 displays tighter binding to most cephalosporins, in
              particular, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and cephalothin (cefalotin),
              and also to the penicillins. NDM-1 does not bind to the
              carbapenems as tightly as IMP-1 or VIM-2 and turns over the
              carbapenems at a rate similar to that of VIM-2. In addition to K.
              pneumoniae 05-506, bla(NDM-1) was found on a 140-kb plasmid in an
              Escherichia coli strain isolated from the patient's feces,
              inferring the possibility of in vivo conjugation. The broad
              resistance carried on these plasmids is a further worrying

              element carrying the $\beta$-lactam resistance gene mecA However,
              many steps are still missing from this evolutionary history. In

              insights into the possible contribution of several species of the
              Staphylococcus sciuri group to the assembly of SCCmec, we
              sequenced the genomes of 106 isolates, comprising S. sciuri (n =
              76), Staphylococcus vitulinus (n = 18), and Staphylococcus

              different abilities to inhibit avocado root rot caused by

              tool for genotyping. Analysis of the entire pathogen genome via

              because of this, the capsule has been extensively studied.
              Studies of the capsule led to the identification of DNA as the

              serotypes, and identification of the serotype-specific nature of

              elucidation of genetic basis for the capsular types, and the

              Conjugate vaccine use has altered the serotype distribution by

              Here, we characterize a novel Streptococcus thermophilus locus,
              CRISPR3, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to integrate
              novel spacers in response to bacteriophage. Also, we analyze
              CRISPR diversity and activity across three distinct CRISPR loci
              in several S. thermophilus strains. We show that both CRISPR
              repeats and cas genes are locus specific and functionally
              coupled. A total of 124 strains were studied, and 109 unique
              spacer arrangements were observed across the three CRISPR loci.
              Overall, 3,626 spacers were analyzed, including 2,829 for CRISPR1
              (782 unique), 173 for CRISPR2 (16 unique), and 624 for CRISPR3
              (154 unique). Sequence analysis of the spacers revealed homology
              and identity to phage sequences (77\%), plasmid sequences (16\%),
              and S. thermophilus chromosomal sequences (7\%). Polymorphisms

              Interestingly, CRISPR loci evolved both via polarized addition of
              novel spacers after exposure to foreign genetic elements and via
              internal deletion of spacers. We hypothesize that the level of
              diversity is correlated with relative CRISPR activity and propose
              that the activity is highest for CRISPR1, followed by CRISPR3,
              while CRISPR2 may be degenerate. Globally, the dynamic nature of
              CRISPR loci might prove valuable for typing and comparative

              We sequenced biological samples artificially spiked with a wide
              range of viruses with genomes composed of single or
              double-stranded DNA or RNA, including linear or circular
              single-stranded DNA. Viruses were added at a very low

              validated level of detection of quantitative reverse

              resembling those represented, in public nucleotide sequence

              identification of viruses was achieved without incorrect

              number of reads generated by the Illumina platform was too small
              to facilitate assembly of contigs without the use of a reference
              sequence, thus precluding detection of unknown viruses. When the

  abstract = "Diagnostic virus isolation is still frequently used, particularly
              from respiratory tract secretions. Testing positive virus
              cultures for all possible viruses is time-consuming, and
              unexpected or unknown viruses may escape detection. Therefore, a
              novel random PCR approach was developed that allows
              sequence-independent amplification of viral nucleic acids from
              virus isolation-positive cultures. Selectivity for viral
              sequences is obtained by preferential isolation of nucleic acids
              that are particle associated and resistant to nucleases. Using
              primers with a degenerated 3' end, the isolated nucleic acids are
              amplified and the randomly amplified PCR products are cloned and
              sequenced. As proof of the concept, the PAN-PCR approach was
              applied to supernatants of coxsackievirus B3 and murine
              adenovirus type 1-infected cells. Enterovirus and adenovirus
              sequences were obtained, demonstrating that the random PCR
              approach allows detection of RNA and DNA viruses. As a first
              application of this PAN-PCR approach, we characterized a virus
              isolate from mouth-washing material of a patient with chronic
              fatigue syndrome and high antibody titers to coxsackievirus B2.
              The virus isolate had tested negative for enteroviruses and
              respiratory viruses (influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza
              virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus)
              by immunofluorescence and PCR. Particle-associated,
              nuclease-resistant RNA and DNA were prepared from the supernatant
              of infected cells. The DNA and the reverse-transcribed RNA were
              randomly amplified, and PCR products were cloned and sequenced.
              Of 25 sequences obtained from the DNA preparation, 24 contained
              herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) sequences from 14 different
              loci spread over the HSV-1 genome. This result was confirmed by
              using a standard diagnostic HSV-PCR, demonstrating that the
              PAN-PCR correctly identified the virus isolate. Although the
              identification of HSV-1 in mouth-washing material is not
              surprising in retrospect, it clearly demonstrates the
              applicability of the PAN-PCR approach. This method should be
              particularly useful for characterizing virus isolates that have
              tested negative for all expected viruses and for identifying
              unknown viruses.",

              (ITS) region has been proposed as a rapid and reliable method for
              the detection of Bartonella species DNA in clinical samples.
              Because of variation in ITS sequences among Bartonella species, a
              single PCR amplification can be used to detect different species
              within this genus. Therefore, by targeting the ITS region,
              multiple PCRs or additional sample-processing steps beyond the
              primary amplification can be avoided when attempting to achieve
              molecular diagnostic detection of Bartonella species. Although
              PCR amplification targeting this region is considered highly
              sensitive, amplification specificity obviously depends on primer
              design. We report evidence of nonspecific PCR amplification of
              Mesorhizobium species with previously published primers that were
              designed to amplify the Bartonella consensus ITS region. Use of
              these or other, less species-specific, primers could lead to a
              false-positive diagnostic test result when evaluating clinical
              samples. We also report the presence of Mesorhizobium species DNA

              sequences in the ITS region that are common to Bartonella and

              with unpublished primers designed in our laboratory targeting the
              ITS region, and the subsequent design of unambiguous ITS primers
              that avoid nonspecific amplification of Mesorhizobium species.
              Our results define some potential limitations associated with the
              molecular detection of Bartonella species in patient samples and
              indicate that primer specificity is of critical importance if the

               However, a comprehensive picture of mycoviral diversity is still
               lacking. To characterize the viromes of five widely dispersed
               plant-pathogenic fungi, Colletotrichum truncatum, Macrophomina
               phaseolina, Diaporthe longicolla, Rhizoctonia solani, and
               Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, a high-throughput sequencing-based
               metatranscriptomic approach was used to detect viral sequences.
               Total RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from mycelia and RNA
               from samples enriched for virus particles were sequenced.
               Sequence data were assembled de novo, and contigs with predicted
               amino acid sequence similarities to viruses in the nonredundant
               protein database were selected. The analysis identified 72
               partial or complete genome segments representing 66 previously
               undescribed mycoviruses. Using primers specific for each viral
               contig, at least one fungal isolate was identified that
               contained each virus. The novel mycoviruses showed affinity with
               15 distinct lineages: Barnaviridae, Benyviridae, Chrysoviridae,
               Endornaviridae, Fusariviridae, Hypoviridae, Mononegavirales,
               Narnaviridae, Ophioviridae, Ourmiavirus, Partitiviridae,
               Tombusviridae, Totiviridae, Tymoviridae, and Virgaviridae More
               than half of the viral sequences were predicted to be members of
               the Mitovirus genus in the family Narnaviridae, which replicate
               within mitochondria. Five viral sequences showed strong affinity
               with three families (Benyviridae, Ophioviridae, and
               Virgaviridae) that previously contained no mycovirus species.
               The genomic information provides insight into the diversity and
               taxonomy of mycoviruses and coevolution of mycoviruses and their
               fungal hosts. IMPORTANCE: Plant-pathogenic fungi reduce crop
               yields, which affects food security worldwide. Plant host
               resistance is considered a sustainable disease management option
               but may often be incomplete or lacking for some crops to certain
               fungal pathogens or strains. In addition, the rising issues of
               fungicide resistance demand alternative strategies to reduce the
               negative impacts of fungal pathogens. Those fungus-infecting
               viruses (mycoviruses) that attenuate fungal virulence may be
               welcome additions for mitigation of plant diseases. By
               high-throughput sequencing of the RNAs from 275 isolates of five
               fungal plant pathogens, 66 previously undescribed mycoviruses
               were identified. In addition to identifying new potential
               biological control agents, these results expand the grand view

              influenza viruses. However, for unknown reasons, viral infections
              rarely cause clinical symptoms in bats. A tight control of viral
              replication by the host innate immune defense might contribute to
              this phenomenon. Transcriptomic studies revealed the presence of
              the interferon-induced antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx)
              proteins in bats, but detailed functional aspects have not been
              assessed. To provide evidence that bat Mx proteins might act as
              key factors to control viral replication we cloned Mx1 cDNAs from
              three bat families, Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae and
              Vespertilionidae. Phylogenetically these bat Mx1 genes cluster
              closely with their human ortholog MxA. Using transfected cell
              cultures, minireplicon systems, virus-like particles and virus
              infections, we determined the antiviral potential of the bat Mx1
              proteins. Bat Mx1 significantly reduced the polymerase activity
              of viruses circulating in bats, including Ebola- and influenza
              A-like viruses. The related Thogoto virus, however, which is not
              known to infect bats was not inhibited by bat Mx1. Further, we
              provide evidence for positive selection in bat Mx1 genes that
              might explain species-specific antiviral activities of these
              proteins. Together, our data suggest a role for Mx1 in
              controlling these viruses in their bat hosts.IMPORTANCE Bats are
              a natural reservoir for various viruses that rarely cause
              clinical symptoms in bats, but comprise dangerous zoonotic
              pathogens like Ebola or Rabies virus. It has been hypothesized
              that the interferon system might play a key role in controlling
              viral replication in bats. We speculate that the
              interferon-induced Mx proteins might be key antiviral factors of
              bats and have coevolved with bat-borne viruses. This study
              evaluates for the first time a large set of bat Mx1 proteins
              spanning three major bat families for their antiviral potential,
              including activity against Ebola virus and bat influenza A-like

              patterns of positive selection that suggest a coevolution with
              viral pathogens. By understanding the molecular mechanisms of the
              innate resistance of bats against viral diseases, we might gain
              important insights into how to prevent and fight human zoonotic

  abstract = "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the most common causes of acute

              transmission. Zoonotic reservoirs (mainly pigs, wild boar, and
              deer) are considered for genotypes 3 and 4, which exist in
              temperate climates. In view of the association of several
              zoonotic viruses with bats, we analyzed 3,869 bat specimens from
              85 different species and from five continents for hepevirus RNA.
              HEVs were detected in African, Central American, and European
              bats, forming a novel phylogenetic clade in the family
              Hepeviridae. Bat hepeviruses were highly diversified and

  abstract = "The 5′ cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA
              stability and protein translation. Many viruses that replicate in
              the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2′-O-methyltransferases
              (2′-O-MTase) to autonomously modify their mRNAs and carry a cap-1
              structure (m7GpppNm) at the 5′ end, thereby facilitating viral
              replication and escaping innate immune recognition in host cells.
              Previous studies showed that the 2′-O-MTase activity of severe
              acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural
              protein 16 (nsp16) needs to be activated by nsp10, whereas nsp16
              of feline coronavirus (FCoV) alone possesses 2′-O-MTase activity
              (E. Decroly et al., J Virol 82:8071--8084, 2008,

              http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294) . In this study,
              we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2′-O-MTase activity by
              nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses,
              including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in
              the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses. Based on our
              current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from
              the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis
              virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the
              2′-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical
              assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV
              replicon models. Interestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust
              inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV
              virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication
              and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of
              infection. Therefore, as a proof of principle, the current
              results indicate that coronavirus 2′-O-MTase activity can be
              targeted in vitro and in vivo. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are
              important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic
              potential. SARS-CoV encodes the 2′-O-MTase that is composed of
              the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and
              plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion
              from innate immunity. Our current results demonstrate that
              stimulation of nsp16 2′-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common
              mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally
              interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different
              coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing
              inhibitory peptides. We demonstrate that a peptide derived from
              the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit
              2′-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral
              replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it
              could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in
              MHV-infected mice. This work makes it possible to develop
              broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional pandemics
              threaten public health worldwide. New alternative strategies for
              generating recombinant viruses with vaccine potential are needed.
              Interestingly, influenza viruses circulating in different hosts
              have been found to have distinct codon usage patterns, which may
              reflect host adaptation. We therefore hypothesized that it is
              possible to make a human seasonal influenza virus that is
              specifically attenuated in human cells but not in eggs by
              converting its codon usage so that it is similar to that observed
              from avian influenza viruses. This approach might help to
              generate human live attenuated viruses without affecting their
              yield in eggs. To test this hypothesis, over 300 silent mutations
              were introduced into the genome of a seasonal H1N1 influenza
              virus. The resultant mutant was significantly attenuated in
              mammalian cells and mice, yet it grew well in embryonated eggs. A
              single dose of intranasal vaccination induced potent innate,
              humoral, and cellular immune responses, and the mutant could
              protect mice against homologous and heterologous viral
              challenges. The attenuated mutant could also be used as a vaccine
              master donor strain by introducing hemagglutinin and
              neuraminidase genes derived from other strains. Thus, our
              approach is a successful strategy to generate attenuated viruses
              for future application as vaccines. IMPORTANCE: Vaccination has
              been one of the best protective measures in combating influenza
              virus infection. Current licensed influenza vaccines and their
              production have various limitations. Our virus attenuation
              strategy makes use of the codon usage biases of human and avian
              influenza viruses to generate a human-derived influenza virus
              that is attenuated in mammalian hosts. This method, however, does
              not affect virus replication in eggs. This makes the resultant
              mutants highly compatible with existing egg-based vaccine
              production pipelines. The viral proteins generated from the codon
              bias mutants are identical to the wild-type viral proteins. In
              addition, our massive genome-wide mutational approach further
              minimizes the concern over reverse mutations. The potential use
              of this kind of codon bias mutant as a master donor strain to
              generate other live attenuated viruses is also demonstrated.

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Influenza viral infection represents a serious public
              health problem that causes contagious respiratory disease, which
              is most effectively prevented through vaccination to reduce
              transmission and future infection. The nonstructural (NS) gene of
              influenza A virus encodes an mRNA transcript that is
              alternatively spliced to express two viral proteins, the
              nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and the nuclear export protein
              (NEP). The importance of the NS gene of influenza A virus for
              viral replication and virulence has been well described and
              represents an attractive target to generate live attenuated
              influenza viruses with vaccine potential. Considering that most
              amino acids can be synthesized from several synonymous codons,
              this study employed the use of misrepresented mammalian codons
              (codon deoptimization) for the de novo synthesis of a viral NS
              RNA segment based on influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8)
              virus. We generated three different recombinant influenza PR8
              viruses containing codon-deoptimized synonymous mutations in
              coding regions comprising the entire NS gene or the mRNA
              corresponding to the individual viral protein NS1 or NEP, without
              modifying the respective splicing and packaging signals of the
              viral segment. The fitness of these synthetic viruses was
              attenuated in vivo, while they retained immunogenicity,
              conferring both homologous and heterologous protection against
              influenza A virus challenges. These results indicate that
              influenza viruses can be effectively attenuated by synonymous
              codon deoptimization of the NS gene and open the possibility of
              their use as a safe vaccine to prevent infections with these
              important human pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Vaccination serves as the
              best therapeutic option to protect humans against influenza viral
              infections. However, the efficacy of current influenza vaccines
              is suboptimal, and novel approaches are necessary for the
              prevention of disease cause by this important human respiratory
              pathogen. The nonstructural (NS) gene of influenza virus encodes
              both the multifunctional nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), essential
              for innate immune evasion, and the nuclear export protein (NEP),
              required for the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins and
              for timing of the virus life cycle. Here, we have generated a
              recombinant influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) virus
              containing a codon-deoptimized NS segment that is attenuated in
              vivo yet retains immunogenicity and protection efficacy against
              homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges. These
              results open the exciting possibility of using this NS codon
              deoptimization methodology alone or in combination with other

              used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the viromes of
              these tick species and identified the presence of Powassan virus
              and eight novel viruses. These included the most divergent

               their host species. If this is upheld, it may then be possible
               to use dinucleotide composition to predict the true host species
               of viruses sampled in metagenomic surveys. However, it is also
               clear that different taxonomic groups of viruses tend to have
               distinctive patterns of dinucleotide composition that may be
               independent of host species. To determine the relative strength
               of the effect of host versus virus family in shaping
               dinucleotide composition, we performed a comparative analysis of
               20 RNA virus families from 15 host groupings, spanning two
               animal phyla and more than 900 virus species. In particular, we
               determined the odds ratios for the 16 possible dinucleotides and
               performed a discriminant analysis to evaluate the capability of
               virus dinucleotide composition to predict the correct virus
               family or host taxon from which it was isolated. Notably, while
               81\% of the data analyzed here were predicted to the correct
               virus family, only 62\% of these data were predicted to their
               correct subphylum/class host and a mere 32\% to their correct
               mammalian order. Similarly, dinucleotide composition has a weak
               predictive power for different hosts within individual virus
               families. We therefore conclude that dinucleotide composition is
               generally uniform within a virus family but less well reflects
               that of its host species. This has obvious implications for
               attempts to accurately predict host species from virus genome
               sequences alone.IMPORTANCE Determining the processes that shape
               virus genomes is central to understanding virus evolution and
               emergence. One question of particular importance is why
               nucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies differ so markedly
               between viruses. In particular, it is currently unclear whether
               host species or virus family has the biggest impact on
               dinucleotide frequencies and whether dinucleotide composition
               can be used to accurately predict host species. Using a
               comparative analysis, we show that dinucleotide composition has
               a strong phylogenetic association across different RNA virus
               families, such that dinucleotide composition can predict the
               family from which a virus sequence has been isolated.
               Conversely, dinucleotide composition has a poorer predictive
               power for the different host species within a virus family and
               across different virus families, indicating that the host has a
               relatively small impact on the dinucleotide composition of a
               virus genome.",

              the major fusion site for synthesis of mRNA 5 (GGUAGAC) does not
              conform to the canonical motif (UC[U,C]AAAC) at three positions
              (underlined), yet it lies just 14 nucleotides downstream from
              such a sequence (UCCAAAC). The infrequently used canonical
              sequence, by computer prediction, is buried within the stem of a

              transcription from either site, (iii) the canonical upstream site
              does not function ectopically to lend competence to the

              ability to replicate, whereas the transcription of subgenomic

  abstract = "Like many eukaryotes, bacteria make widespread use of
              postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of
              DNA-protein interactions. Unlike eukaryotes, however, bacteria
              use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine
              methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation
              plays roles in the virulence of diverse pathogens of humans and
              livestock animals, including pathogenic Escherichia coli,
              Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In
              Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine at GANTC sites by the
              CcrM methylase regulates the cell cycle and couples gene
              transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine
              methylation at GATC sites by the Dam methylase provides signals
              for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair,
              packaging of bacteriophage genomes, transposase activity, and
              regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional repression by Dam
              methylation appears to be more common than transcriptional
              activation. Certain promoters are active only during the
              hemimethylation interval that follows DNA replication; repression
              is restored when the newly synthesized DNA strand is methylated.
              In the E. coli genome, however, methylation of specific GATC
              sites can be blocked by cognate DNA binding proteins. Blockage of
              GATC methylation beyond cell division permits transmission of DNA
              methylation patterns to daughter cells and can give rise to
              distinct epigenetic states, each propagated by a positive
              feedback loop. Switching between alternative DNA methylation
              patterns can split clonal bacterial populations into epigenetic
              lineages in a manner reminiscent of eukaryotic cell
              differentiation. Inheritance of self-propagating DNA methylation
              patterns governs phase variation in the E. coli pap operon, the
              agn43 gene, and other loci encoding virulence-related cell

              (sacB-neo) into the small-subunit rRNA-encoding gene rrs in the
              rrnB operon. During growth in a complex medium, the cassette was
              lost from the population, and a complete rrs gene was restored at
              a rate of 5 x 10(-9) per cell division. Repair of this lesion
              required flanking regions of DNA that were similar to the six
              remaining intact rRNA operons and reestablished the full
              complement of seven rRNA operons. The relative fitness of strains
              with restored rrnB operons was 1 to 2\% higher than that of the
              mutant strain. The rrnB operon normally contains a spacer region
              between the 16S and 23S rRNA-encoding genes that is similar in
              length and tRNA gene content to the spacer in rrnC, -E, and -G.
              In 2 of the 14 strains in which rrnB was restored, the spacer
              region had the same length as the spacer region in rrnA, -D, and
              -H. The requirement for flanking regions of nearly identical DNA
              and the replication of the spacer region from other rRNA operons
              during the repair of rrnB suggest that the restoration was
              accomplished via gene conversion. The rate of gene conversion was
              10-fold less than the fixation of point mutations in the same
              region of the chromosome but was apparently sufficient to
              homogenize the sequences of rRNA genes in E. coli. These findings

              cyanobacteria that are morphologically diverse and ecologically
              versatile. Studies over the last decade have established members
              of this genus to be important components of the marine ecosystem,
              contributing significantly to the nitrogen and carbon cycle.
              System-level studies of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a prototypic
              member of this group, revealed many interesting metabolic
              attributes. To identify the metabolic traits that define this
              class of cyanobacteria, five additional Cyanothece strains were
              sequenced to completion. The presence of a large, contiguous
              nitrogenase gene cluster and the ability to carry out aerobic
              nitrogen fixation distinguish Cyanothece as a genus of
              unicellular, aerobic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Cyanothece
              cells can create an anoxic intracellular environment at night,
              allowing oxygen-sensitive processes to take place in these
              oxygenic organisms. Large carbohydrate reserves accumulate in the
              cells during the day, ensuring sufficient energy for the
              processes that require the anoxic phase of the cells. Our study
              indicates that this genus maintains a plastic genome,
              incorporating new metabolic capabilities while simultaneously
              retaining archaic metabolic traits, a unique combination which
              provides the flexibility to adapt to various ecological and
              environmental conditions. Rearrangement of the nitrogenase
              cluster in Cyanothece sp. strain 7425 and the concomitant loss of
              its aerobic nitrogen-fixing ability suggest that a similar
              mechanism might have been at play in cyanobacterial strains that
              eventually lost their nitrogen-fixing ability. IMPORTANCE: The
              unicellular cyanobacterial genus Cyanothece has significant roles
              in the nitrogen cycle in aquatic and terrestrial environments.
              Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 was extensively studied over the last
              decade and has emerged as an important model photosynthetic
              microbe for bioenergy production. To expand our understanding of
              the distinctive metabolic capabilities of this cyanobacterial
              group, we analyzed the genome sequences of five additional
              Cyanothece strains from different geographical habitats,
              exhibiting diverse morphological and physiological attributes.
              These strains exhibit high rates of N(2) fixation and H(2)
              production under aerobic conditions. They can generate copious
              amounts of carbohydrates that are stored in large starch-like
              granules and facilitate energy-intensive processes during the
              dark, anoxic phase of the cells. The genomes of some Cyanothece
              strains are quite unique in that there are linear elements in
              addition to a large circular chromosome. Our study provides novel

               the availability of treatment options as well their application.
               Since early and targeted antimicrobial intervention is one of

               current diagnostic approaches for identifying these infections
               all rely on time-consuming blood culture, which precludes

              whether the integrated DNA contains labeled nucleotides needs to

              comprehensive genetic characterization of all known vertebrate
              viruses, their genetic variants, and novel viruses. The

              clinical Enterobacter species isolates that were both carbapenem

              decipher the molecular origins of carbapenem resistance and to
              understand the changing phylogeny of these emerging and
              drug-resistant pathogens. Of the carbapenem-resistant isolates,
              30 possessed blaKPC-2, 40 had blaKPC-3, 2 had blaKPC-4, and 2 had
              blaNDM-1Twenty-three isolates were carbapenem susceptible. Six
              genomes were sequenced to completion, and their sizes ranged from
              4.6 to 5.1 Mbp. Phylogenomic analysis placed 96 of these genomes,
              351 additional Enterobacter genomes downloaded from NCBI GenBank,
              and six newly sequenced type strains into 19 phylogenomic
              groups-18 groups (A to R) in the Enterobacter cloacae complex and
              Enterobacter aerogenes Diverse mechanisms underlying the
              molecular evolutionary trajectory of these drug-resistant
              Enterobacter spp. were revealed, including the acquisition of an
              antibiotic resistance plasmid, followed by clonal spread,
              horizontal transfer of blaKPC-harboring plasmids between
              different phylogenomic groups, and repeated transposition of the
              blaKPCgene among different plasmid backbones. Group A, which
              comprises multilocus sequence type 171 (ST171), was the most
              commonly identified (23\% of isolates). Genomic analysis showed
              that ST171 isolates evolved from a common ancestor and formed two
              different major clusters; each acquiring unique blaKPC-harboring
              plasmids, followed by clonal expansion. The data presented here
              represent the first comprehensive study of phylogenomic
              interrogation and the relationship between antibiotic resistance
              and plasmid discrimination among carbapenem-resistant
              Enterobacter spp., demonstrating the genetic diversity and
              complexity of the molecular mechanisms driving antibiotic
              resistance in this genus. IMPORTANCE: Enterobacter spp.,
              especially carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter spp., have
              emerged as a clinically significant cause of nosocomial
              infections. However, only limited information is available on the
              distribution of carbapenem resistance across this genus.
              Augmenting this problem is an erroneous identification of
              Enterobacter strains because of ambiguous typing methods and
              imprecise taxonomy. In this study, we used a whole-genome-based
              comparative phylogenetic approach to (i) revisit and redefine the
              genus Enterobacter and (ii) unravel the emergence and evolution
              of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-harboring Enterobacter
              spp. Using genomic analysis of 447 sequenced strains, we
              developed an improved understanding of the species designations

              doctor's recommendation or at their own discretion to improve
              their overall health and well-being. This is a rapidly growing
              trend, with an associated and expanding manufacturing industry to
              meet the demand for new health-related products. In this study,
              we examined the contents and microbial viability of several
              popular probiotic products on the United States market.
              Culture-independent methods are proving ideal for fast and
              efficient analysis of foodborne pathogens and their associated
              microbial communities but may also be relevant for analyzing
              probiotics containing mixed microbial constituents. These
              products were subjected to next-generation whole-genome
              sequencing and analyzed by a custom in-house-developed k-mer
              counting method to validate manufacturer label information. In
              addition, the batch variability of respective products was
              examined to determine if any changes in their formulations and/or
              the manufacturing process occurred. Overall, the products we
              tested adhered to the ingredient claims and lot-to-lot
              differences were minimal. However, there were a few discrepancies
              in the naming of closely related Lactobacillus and
              Bifidobacterium species, whereas one product contained an
              apparent Enterococcus contaminant in two of its three lots. With

              assess our results and verify the viability of the microbes in
              these products with regard to the labeling claims. Of all the
              supplements examined, only one was found to be inaccurate in
              viability. Our use of next-generation sequencing as an analytical
              tool clearly demonstrated its utility for quickly analyzing

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT Metagenomic profiling is challenging in part because of
               the highly uneven sampling of the tree of life by genome
               sequencing projects and the limitations imposed by performing
               phylogenetic inference at fixed taxonomic ranks. We present the
               algorithm MetaPalette, which uses long k-mer sizes (k = 30, 50)
               to fit a k-mer ``palette'' of a given sample to the k-mer
               palette of reference organisms. By modeling the k-mer palettes
               of unknown organisms, the method also gives an indication of the
               presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel
               organisms present in the sample. The method returns a
               traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on
               independently simulated data to be one of the most accurate to
               date. Tree figures are also returned that quantify the
               relatedness of novel organisms to reference sequences, and the
               accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins
               and a metagenomic soil sample. The software implementing

               step when analyzing a metagenomic sample. This work presents a
               method that facilitates fine-scale characterization of the
               presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of organisms
               present in a given sample but absent from the training database.
               We calculate a ``k-mer palette'' which summarizes the
               information from all reads, not just those in conserved genes or
               containing taxon-specific markers. The compositions of palettes
               are easy to model, allowing rapid inference of community
               composition. In addition to providing strain-level information
               where applicable, our approach provides taxonomic profiles that

  abstract = "Bacteria possess an amazing capacity to synthesize a diverse
              range of structurally complex, bioactive natural products known
              as specialized (or secondary) metabolites. Many of these
              specialized metabolites are used as clinical therapeutics, while
              others have important ecological roles in microbial communities.
              The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that generate these
              metabolites can be identified in bacterial genome sequences using
              their highly conserved genetic features. We analyzed an
              unprecedented 1,566 bacterial genomes from Bacillus species and
              identified nearly 20,000 BGCs. By comparing these BGCs to one
              another as well as a curated set of known specialized metabolite
              BGCs, we discovered that the majority of Bacillus natural
              products are comprised of a small set of highly conserved,
              well-distributed, known natural product compounds. Most of these
              metabolites have important roles influencing the physiology and
              development of Bacillus species. We identified, in addition to
              these characterized compounds, many unique, weakly conserved BGCs
              scattered across the genus that are predicted to encode unknown
              natural products. Many of these ``singleton'' BGCs appear to have
              been acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Based on this
              large-scale characterization of metabolite production in the
              Bacilli, we go on to connect the alkylpyrones, natural products
              that are highly conserved but previously biologically
              uncharacterized, to a role in Bacillus physiology: inhibiting
              spore development. IMPORTANCEBacilli are capable of producing a
              diverse array of specialized metabolites, many of which have
              gained attention for their roles as signals that affect bacterial
              physiology and development. Up to this point, however, the
              Bacillus genus's metabolic capacity has been underexplored. We
              undertook a deep genomic analysis of 1,566 Bacillus genomes to
              understand the full spectrum of metabolites that this bacterial
              group can make. We discovered that the majority of the
              specialized metabolites produced by Bacillus species are highly
              conserved, known compounds with important signaling roles in the
              physiology and development of this bacterium. Additionally, there
              is significant unique biosynthetic machinery distributed across
              the genus that might lead to new, unknown metabolites with
              diverse biological functions. Inspired by the findings of our
              genomic analysis, we speculate that the highly conserved
              alkylpyrones might have an important biological activity within
              this genus. We go on to validate this prediction by demonstrating
              that these natural products are developmental signals in Bacillus

              community composition, yet little is known about the traits of

              which is a fully automated software package for deriving
              phenotypes from a genome sequence. Traitar provides phenotype
              classifiers to predict 67 traits related to the use of various

              morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, proteolysis, and enzymatic

              wastewater treatment or decontamination of polluted soils.
              Diverse bacteria contribute with their unique capabilities to the
              functioning of such ecosystems, but lab experiments to
              investigate those capabilities are labor-intensive. Major
              advances in sequencing techniques open up the opportunity to
              study bacteria by their genome sequences. For this purpose, we

               natural products, are key mediators of microbe-microbe and
               host-microbe interactions and constitute a rich resource for
               drug development. In the past decade, genome mining has emerged
               as a prominent strategy for natural product discovery.
               Initially, such mining was performed on the basis of individual
               microbial genome sequences. Now, these efforts are being scaled
               up to fully genome-sequenced strain collections, pangenomes of
               bacterial genera, and large sets of metagenome-assembled genomes
               from microbial communities. The Medema research group aims to
               play a leading role in these developments by developing and
               applying computational approaches to identify, classify, and

  abstract = "Anti-CRISPR (Acr) loci/operons encode Acr proteins and
              Acr-associated (Aca) proteins. Forty-five Acr families have been
              experimentally characterized inhibiting seven subtypes of
              CRISPR-Cas systems. We have developed a bioinformatics pipeline
              to identify genomic loci containing Acr homologs and/or Aca
              homologs by combining three computational approaches: homology,
              guilt-by-association, and self-targeting spacers. Homology search
              found thousands of Acr homologs in bacterial and viral genomes,
              but most are homologous to AcrIIA7 and AcrIIA9. Investigating the
              gene neighborhood of these Acr homologs revealed that only a
              small percentage (23.0\% in bacteria and 8.2\% in viruses) of
              them have neighboring Aca homologs and thus form Acr-Aca operons.
              Surprisingly, although a self-targeting spacer is a strong
              indicator of the presence of Acr genes in a genome, a large
              percentage of Acr-Aca loci are found in bacterial genomes without
              self-targeting spacers or even without complete CRISPR-Cas
              systems. Additionally, for Acr homologs from genomes with
              self-targeting spacers, homology-based Acr family assignments do
              not always agree with the self-targeting CRISPR-Cas subtypes.
              Last, by investigating Acr genomic loci coexisting with
              self-targeting spacers in the same genomes, five known subtypes
              (I-C, I-E, I-F, II-A, and II-C) and five new subtypes (I-B,
              III-A, III-B, IV-A, and V-U4) of Acrs were inferred. Based on
              these findings, we conclude that the discovery of new
              anti-CRISPRs should not be restricted to genomes with
              self-targeting spacers and loci with Acr homologs. The
              evolutionary arms race of CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR
              systems may have driven the adaptive and rapid gain and loss of
              these elements in closely related genomes.IMPORTANCE As a
              naturally occurring adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas (clustered
              regularly interspersed short palindromic
              repeats-CRISPR-associated genes) systems are widely found in
              bacteria and archaea to defend against viruses. Since 2013, the
              application of various bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems has become
              very popular due to their development into targeted and
              programmable genome engineering tools with the ability to edit
              almost any genome. As the natural off-switch of CRISPR-Cas
              systems, anti-CRISPRs have a great potential to serve as
              regulators of CRISPR-Cas tools and enable safer and more
              controllable genome editing. This study will help understand the
              relative usefulness of the three bioinformatics approaches for
              new Acr discovery, as well as guide the future development of new
              bioinformatics tools to facilitate anti-CRISPR research. The
              thousands of Acr homologs and hundreds of new anti-CRISPR loci
              identified in this study will be a valuable data resource for
              genome engineers to search for new CRISPR-Cas regulators.",

              (IS) have increased enormously since their discovery in the late
              1960s. At present the sequences of more than 4000 different IS
              have been deposited in the specialized ISfinder database. Over
              time it has become increasingly apparent that they are important
              actors in the evolution of their host genomes and are involved in
              sequestering, transmitting, mutating and activating genes, and in
              the rearrangement of both plasmids and chromosomes. This review
              presents an overview of our current understanding of these
              transposable elements (TE), their organization and their
              transposition mechanism as well as their distribution and genomic
              impact. In spite of their diversity, they share only a very
              limited number of transposition mechanisms which we outline here.
              Prokaryotic IS are but one example of a variety of diverse TE
              which are being revealed due to the advent of extensive genome

              alteration in the gut microbial community of genetically
              predisposed subjects. However, existing profiles of gut
              microbiome dysbiosis in adult IBD patients are inconsistent among
              published studies, and did not allow the identification of
              microbial signatures for CD and UC. Here, we aimed to compare the
              faecal microbiome of CD with patients having UC and with non-IBD
              subjects in a longitudinal study. DESIGN: We analysed a cohort of
              2045 non-IBD and IBD faecal samples from four countries (Spain,
              Belgium, the UK and Germany), applied a 16S rRNA sequencing
              approach and analysed a total dataset of 115 million sequences.
              RESULTS: In the Spanish cohort, dysbiosis was found significantly
              greater in patients with CD than with UC, as shown by a more
              reduced diversity, a less stable microbial community and eight
              microbial groups were proposed as a specific microbial signature
              for CD. Tested against the whole cohort, the signature achieved
              an overall sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 94\%, 94\%,
              89\% and 91\% for the detection of CD versus healthy controls,
              patients with anorexia, IBS and UC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
              Although UC and CD share many epidemiologic, immunologic,
              therapeutic and clinical features, our results showed that they
              are two distinct subtypes of IBD at the microbiome level. For the
              first time, we are proposing microbiomarkers to discriminate
              between CD and non-CD independently of geographical regions.",

               generate energy and reducing power directly from sunlight and
               water, freeing it from the limited resources of geochemically
               derived reductants. This greatly increased global primary
               productivity and restructured ecosystems. The release of O2 as
               an end product of water oxidation led to the rise of oxygen,
               which dramatically altered the redox state of Earth's atmosphere
               and oceans and permanently changed all major biogeochemical
               cycles. Furthermore, the biological availability of O2 allowed
               for the evolution of aerobic respiration and novel biosynthetic
               pathways, facilitating much of the richness we associate with
               modern biology, including complex multicellularity. Here we

               and biological records for the origin and evolution of oxygenic
               photosynthesis. Data from both of these archives illustrate that

               Antitoxins are more labile than toxins and are readily degraded

              organisms has improved steadily over the past decade, but there
              is still room for improvement. Increasing the number of correct
              identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation
              sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false
              positives, are all desirable goals. RESULTS: With our years of
              experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome
              Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called
              Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding
              ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three
              goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation
              initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We
              compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods
              to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives. CONCLUSION:
              We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program
              called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal
              achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we

              combinations, while penalizing higher confidence domains if such
              combinations have never been observed. Our framework, Domain

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fueled by rapid progress in high-throughput
              sequencing, the size of public sequence databases doubles every
              two years. Searching the ever larger and more redundant databases
              is getting increasingly inefficient. Clustering can help to
              organize sequences into homologous and functionally similar
              groups and can improve the speed, sensitivity, and readability of
              homology searches. However, because the clustering time is
              quadratic in the number of sequences, standard sequence search
              methods are becoming impracticable. RESULTS: Here we present a
              method to cluster large protein sequence databases such as
              UniProt within days down to 20\%-30\% maximum pairwise sequence
              identity. kClust owes its speed and sensitivity to an
              alignment-free prefilter that calculates the cumulative score of
              all similar 6-mers between pairs of sequences, and to a dynamic
              programming algorithm that operates on pairs of similar 4-mers.
              To increase sensitivity further, kClust can run in
              profile-sequence comparison mode, with profiles computed from the
              clusters of a previous kClust iteration. kClust is two to three
              orders of magnitude faster than clustering based on NCBI BLAST,
              and on multidomain sequences of 20\%-30\% maximum pairwise
              sequence identity it achieves comparable sensitivity and a lower
              false discovery rate. It also compares favorably to CD-HIT and
              UCLUST in terms of false discovery rate, sensitivity, and speed.
              CONCLUSIONS: kClust fills the need for a fast, sensitive, and

              below 30\% sequence identity. kClust is freely available under

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: For the last 25 years species delimitation in
              prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria) was to a large extent based on
              DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), a tedious lab procedure designed in
              the early 1970s that served its purpose astonishingly well in the
              absence of deciphered genome sequences. With the rapid progress
              in genome sequencing time has come to directly use the now
              available and easy to generate genome sequences for delimitation
              of species. GBDP (Genome Blast Distance Phylogeny) infers
              genome-to-genome distances between pairs of entirely or partially
              sequenced genomes, a digital, highly reliable estimator for the
              relatedness of genomes. Its application as an in-silico
              replacement for DDH was recently introduced. The main challenge
              in the implementation of such an application is to produce
              digital DDH values that must mimic the wet-lab DDH values as
              close as possible to ensure consistency in the Prokaryotic
              species concept. RESULTS: Correlation and regression analyses
              were used to determine the best-performing methods and the most
              influential parameters. GBDP was further enriched with a set of
              new features such as confidence intervals for intergenomic
              distances obtained via resampling or via the statistical models
              for DDH prediction and an additional family of distance
              functions. As in previous analyses, GBDP obtained the highest
              agreement with wet-lab DDH among all tested methods, but improved
              models led to a further increase in the accuracy of DDH
              prediction. Confidence intervals yielded stable results when
              inferred from the statistical models, whereas those obtained via
              resampling showed marked differences between the underlying
              distance functions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high accuracy of
              GBDP-based DDH prediction, inferences from limited empirical data
              are always associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. It is
              thus crucial to enrich in-silico DDH replacements with
              confidence-interval estimation, enabling the user to
              statistically evaluate the outcomes. Such methodological
              advancements, easily accessible through the web service at

              bacterial draft genomes, assembled using either a single Illumina

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The influenza A virus is an important infectious
              cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and was responsible
              for 3 pandemics in the 20th century. As the replication of the
              influenza virus is based on its host's machinery, codon usage of
              its viral genes might be subject to host selection pressures,
              especially after interspecies transmission. A better
              understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive responses
              might help control this disease. RESULTS: Relative Synonymous
              Codon Usage (RSCU) values of the genes from segment 1 to segment
              6 of avian and human influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1,
              were studied via Correspondence Analysis (CA). The codon usage
              patterns of seasonal human influenza viruses were distinct among
              their subtypes and different from those of avian viruses. Newly
              isolated viruses could be added to the CA results, creating a
              tool to investigate the host origin and evolution of viral genes.
              It was found that the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus contained genes
              with mammalian-like viral codon usage patterns, indicating that
              the introduction of this virus to humans was not through in toto
              transfer of an avian influenza virus.Many human viral genes had
              directional changes in codon usage over time of viral isolation,
              indicating the effect of host selection pressures. These changes
              reduced the overall GC content and the usage of G at the third
              codon position in the viral genome. Limited evidence of
              translational selection pressure was found in a few viral genes.
              CONCLUSIONS: Codon usage patterns from CA allowed identification
              of host origin and evolutionary trends in influenza viruses,
              providing an alternative method and a tool to understand the
              evolution of influenza viruses. Human influenza viruses are
              subject to selection pressure on codon usage which might assist
              in understanding the characteristics of newly emerging viruses.",

              phylogenetic methods, but this affiliation was strongly supported

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) is a
              coniferous tree of tremendous ecological and economic importance.
              It is a member of the family Cupressaceae which also includes
              cypresses, redwoods, sequoias, thujas, and junipers. While the
              bald cypress genome is more than three times the size of the
              human genome, its 1C DNA content is amongst the smallest of any
              conifer. To learn more about the genome of bald cypress and gain
              insight into the evolution of Cupressaceae genomes, we performed
              a Cot analysis and used Cot filtration to study Taxodium DNA.
              Additionally, we constructed a 6.7 genome-equivalent BAC library
              that we screened with known Taxodium genes and select repeats.
              RESULTS: The bald cypress genome is composed of 90\% repetitive
              DNA with most sequences being found in low to mid copy numbers.
              The most abundant repeats are found in fewer than 25,000 copies
              per genome. Approximately 7.4\% of the genome is single/low-copy
              DNA (i.e., sequences found in 1 to 5 copies). Sequencing of
              highly repetitive Cot clones indicates that most Taxodium repeats
              are highly diverged from previously characterized plant repeat
              sequences. The bald cypress BAC library consists of 606,336
              clones (average insert size of 113 kb) and collectively provides
              6.7-fold genome equivalent coverage of the bald cypress genome.
              Macroarray screening with known genes produced, on average, about
              1.5 positive clones per probe per genome-equivalent. Library
              screening with Cot-1 DNA revealed that approximately 83\% of BAC
              clones contain repetitive sequences iterated 103 to 104 times per

              first to be generated for a conifer species outside of the family
              Pinaceae. The Taxodium BAC library was shown to be useful in gene
              isolation and genome characterization and should be an important
              tool in gymnosperm comparative genomics, physical mapping, genome
              sequencing, and gene/polymorphism discovery. The single/low-copy
              (SL) component of bald cypress is 4.6 times the size of the
              Arabidopsis genome. As suggested for other gymnosperms, the large
              amount of SL DNA in Taxodium is likely the result of divergence
              among ancient repeat copies and gene/pseudogene duplication.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is often used for
              transcriptome profiling as well as the identification of novel
              transcripts and alternative splicing events. Typically, RNA-Seq
              libraries are prepared from total RNA using poly(A) enrichment of
              the mRNA (mRNA-Seq) to remove ribosomal RNA (rRNA), however, this
              method fails to capture non-poly(A) transcripts or partially
              degraded mRNAs. Hence, a mRNA-Seq protocol will not be compatible
              for use with RNAs coming from Formalin-Fixed and
              Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples. RESULTS: To address the desire
              to perform RNA-Seq on FFPE materials, we evaluated two different
              library preparation protocols that could be compatible for use
              with small RNA fragments. We obtained paired Fresh Frozen (FF)
              and FFPE RNAs from multiple tumors and subjected these to
              different gene expression profiling methods. We tested 11 human
              breast tumor samples using: (a) FF RNAs by microarray, mRNA-Seq,
              Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq (Duplex-Specific Nuclease) and (b) FFPE
              RNAs by Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq. We also performed these
              different RNA-Seq protocols using 10 TCGA tumors as a validation
              set.The data from paired RNA samples showed high concordance in
              transcript quantification across all protocols and between FF and
              FFPE RNAs. In both FF and FFPE, Ribo-Zero-Seq removed rRNA with
              comparable efficiency as mRNA-Seq, and it provided an equivalent
              or less biased coverage on gene 3' ends. Compared to mRNA-Seq
              where 69\% of bases were mapped to the transcriptome, DSN-Seq and
              Ribo-Zero-Seq contained significantly fewer reads mapping to the
              transcriptome (20-30\%); in these RNA-Seq protocols, many if not
              most reads mapped to intronic regions. Approximately 14 million
              reads in mRNA-Seq and 45-65 million reads in Ribo-Zero-Seq or
              DSN-Seq were required to achieve the same gene detection levels
              as a standard Agilent DNA microarray. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
              demonstrate that compared to mRNA-Seq and microarrays,
              Ribo-Zero-Seq provides equivalent rRNA removal efficiency,
              coverage uniformity, genome-based mapped reads, and consistently
              high quality quantification of transcripts. Moreover,
              Ribo-Zero-Seq and DSN-Seq have consistent transcript
              quantification using FFPE RNAs, suggesting that RNA-Seq can be
              used with FFPE-derived RNAs for gene expression profiling.",

              about reconstructing species trees in the presence of HGT alone

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: During the last 15 years the internal transcribed
              spacer (ITS) of nuclear DNA has been used as a target for
              analyzing fungal diversity in environmental samples, and has
              recently been selected as the standard marker for fungal DNA
              barcoding. In this study we explored the potential amplification
              biases that various commonly utilized ITS primers might introduce
              during amplification of different parts of the ITS region in
              samples containing mixed templates ('environmental barcoding').
              We performed in silico PCR analyses with commonly used primer
              combinations using various ITS datasets obtained from public
              databases as templates. RESULTS: Some of the ITS primers, such as
              ITS1-F, were hampered with a high proportion of mismatches
              relative to the target sequences, and most of them appeared to
              introduce taxonomic biases during PCR. Some primers, e.g. ITS1-F,
              ITS1 and ITS5, were biased towards amplification of
              basidiomycetes, whereas others, e.g. ITS2, ITS3 and ITS4, were
              biased towards ascomycetes. The assumed basidiomycete-specific
              primer ITS4-B only amplified a minor proportion of basidiomycete
              ITS sequences, even under relaxed PCR conditions. Due to
              systematic length differences in the ITS2 region as well as the
              entire ITS, we found that ascomycetes will more easily amplify
              than basidiomycetes using these regions as targets. This bias can
              be avoided by using primers amplifying ITS1 only, but this would
              imply preferential amplification of 'non-dikarya' fungi.
              CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ITS primers have to be selected
              carefully, especially when used for high-throughput sequencing of
              environmental samples. We suggest that different primer
              combinations or different parts of the ITS region should be
              analyzed in parallel, or that alternative ITS primers should be
              searched for.",

              technique for nucleic acid detection and quantification. These
              assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the
              clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is
              critical for accurate diagnosis in the clinic, yet current
              primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and
              signature evaluation methods are lacking. METHODS: We assessed
              the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true
              positive, false positive and false negative hits against all
              available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR signatures
              described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based
              approach to collect all hits to the primer-probe combinations
              that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then
              compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree
              that the signature was designed to detect. RESULTS: We found that
              many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false
              positives) but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where
              high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised methodology for
              signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are
              required to detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology
              to produce new signatures that are predicted to have higher
              sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: We show that current
              methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably low
              sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as
              new sequence data becomes available, old assays must be

              clinical diagnostics. The improved assay design and evaluation

              combined with next generation sequencing, however, we set up a
              simplified VIDISCA which can be used in case next generation
              sequencing is not possible. Stool samples of 10 patients with
              unexplained acute flaccid paralysis showing cytopathic effect in

              viruses (70\%) and the proportion of eukaryotic viral sequences

              type-3, human astrovirus probably a type-3/5 recombinant, and
              tetnovirus-1 were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on the
              VP1 region demonstrated that the human enteroviruses are more
              divergent isolates circulating in the community. CONCLUSION: Our
              data support that a simplified VIDISCA protocol can efficiently
              identify unrecognized viruses grown in cell culture with low
              cost, limited time without need of advanced technical expertise.
              Also complex data interpretation is avoided thus the method can

              known overlays, we tested suspensions of microcrystalline
              cellulose Avicel RC/CLtrade mark as overlay media in the plaque
              and plaque-inhibition assay of influenza viruses. RESULTS:
              Significantly larger plaques were formed under Avicel-containing
              media, as compared to agar and methylcellulose (MC) overlay
              media. The plaque size increased with decreasing Avicel
              concentration, but even very diluted Avicel overlays (0.3\%)
              ensured formation of localized plaques. Due to their low
              viscosity, Avicel overlays were easier to use than
              methylcellulose overlays, especially in the 96-well culture
              plates. Furthermore, Avicel overlay could be applied without
              prior removal of the virus inoculum thus facilitating the assay
              and reducing chances of cross-contamination. Using neuraminidase

              population. PCR primer pairs are then selected computationally to
              produce a minimal amplicon set capable of tiling across the full
              length of the specified target region. As part of the tiling
              process, primer pairs are computationally screened to meet the
              criteria for successful PCR with one of two described
              amplification protocols. The actual sequencing success rates for
              designed primers for measles virus, mumps virus, human
              parainfluenza virus 1 and 3, human respiratory syncytial virus A
              and B and human metapneumovirus are described, where >90\% of
              designed primer pairs were able to consistently successfully
              amplify >75\% of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Augmenting our
              previously developed and published JCVI Primer Design Pipeline,
              we achieved similarly high sequencing success rates with only
              minor software modifications. The recommended methodology for the
              construction of the consensus sequence that encapsulates the
              allelic variation of the targeted population and is a key step
              prior to designing degenerate primers is also formally described.",

              random forest",
  author   = "Eng, Christine L P and Tong, Joo Chuan and Tan, Tin Wee",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Majority of influenza A viruses reside and circulate
              among animal populations, seldom infecting humans due to host
              range restriction. Yet when some avian strains do acquire the
              ability to overcome species barrier, they might become adapted to
              humans, replicating efficiently and causing diseases, leading to
              potential pandemic. With the huge influenza A virus reservoir in
              wild birds, it is a cause for concern when a new influenza strain
              emerges with the ability to cross host species barrier, as shown
              in light of the recent H7N9 outbreak in China. Several influenza
              proteins have been shown to be major determinants in host
              tropism. Further understanding and determining host tropism would
              be important in identifying zoonotic influenza virus strains
              capable of crossing species barrier and infecting humans.
              RESULTS: In this study, computational models for 11 influenza
              proteins have been constructed using the machine learning
              algorithm random forest for prediction of host tropism. The
              prediction models were trained on influenza protein sequences
              isolated from both avian and human samples, which were
              transformed into amino acid physicochemical properties feature
              vectors. The results were highly accurate prediction models
              (ACC>96.57; AUC>0.980; MCC>0.916) capable of determining host
              tropism of individual influenza proteins. In addition, features
              from all 11 proteins were used to construct a combined model to
              predict host tropism of influenza virus strains. This would help
              assess a novel influenza strain's host range capability.
              CONCLUSIONS: From the prediction models constructed, all achieved
              high prediction performance, indicating clear distinctions in
              both avian and human proteins. When used together as a host
              tropism prediction system, zoonotic strains could potentially be
              identified based on different protein prediction results.
              Understanding and predicting host tropism of influenza proteins
              lay an important foundation for future work in constructing
              computation models capable of directly predicting interspecies
              transmission of influenza viruses. The models are available for

              Approximately 10\% of these genomes have been published in

              and 175 RNA genes as well as a single plasmid. Affiliation of a

              outgroup strains to the type strain of E. coli was investigated

              Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence, make
              recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.
              METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using
              Medline and PubMed searches. We determined a list of key
              questions and convened a 2-day consensus conference to develop

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
              repeats (CRISPRs) are a novel class of direct repeats, separated
              by unique spacer sequences of similar length, that are present in
              approximately 40\% of bacterial and most archaeal genomes
              analyzed to date. More than 40 gene families, called
              CRISPR-associated sequences (CASs), appear in conjunction with
              these repeats and are thought to be involved in the propagation
              and functioning of CRISPRs. It has been recently shown that
              CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in
              prokaryotes. RESULTS: Here we analyze CRISPR repeats identified
              in 195 microbial genomes and show that they can be organized into
              multiple clusters based on sequence similarity. Some of the
              clusters present stable, highly conserved RNA secondary
              structures, while others lack detectable structures. Stable
              secondary structures exhibit multiple compensatory base changes
              in the stem region, indicating evolutionary and functional
              conservation. CONCLUSION: We show that the repeat-based
              classification corresponds to, and expands upon, a previously
              reported CAS gene-based classification, including specific
              relationships between CRISPR and CAS subtypes.",

              causes of microbial diseases in humans. The genomes of 44 diverse
              strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains
              of non-pathogenic streptococci of the Mitis group. RESULTS:
              Despite evidence of extensive recombination, the S. pneumoniae
              phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. With the exception
              of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype,
              geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The
              distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one
              strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny,
              although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this
              correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous
              recombination, involving short stretches of DNA, was the dominant
              evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic
              exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the
              species, and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity
              of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased
              logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the
              number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting
              that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of
              clones. Most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by
              all S. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in S. mitis, S.
              oralis and S. infantis, indicating that these genes are not
              sufficient to determine virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange
              with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the
              main mechanism of evolution of S. pneumoniae. The open pan-genome

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: With rapid advancements in technology, the sequences
              of thousands of species' genomes are becoming available. Within
              the sequences are repeats that comprise significant portions of
              genomes. Successful annotations thus require accurate discovery
              of repeats. As species-specific elements, repeats in newly
              sequenced genomes are likely to be unknown. Therefore, annotating
              newly sequenced genomes requires tools to discover repeats
              de-novo. However, the currently available de-novo tools have
              limitations concerning the size of the input sequence, ease of
              use, sensitivities to major types of repeats, consistency of
              performance, speed, and false positive rate. RESULTS: To address
              these limitations, I designed and developed Red, applying Machine
              Learning. Red is the first repeat-detection tool capable of
              labeling its training data and training itself automatically on
              an entire genome. Red is easy to install and use. It is sensitive
              to both transposons and simple repeats; in contrast, available
              tools such as RepeatScout and ReCon are sensitive to transposons,
              and WindowMasker to simple repeats. Red performed consistently
              well on seven genomes; the other tools performed well only on
              some genomes. Red is much faster than RepeatScout and ReCon and
              has a much lower false positive rate than WindowMasker. On human
              genes with five or more copies, Red was more specific than
              RepeatScout by a wide margin. When tested on genomes of unusual
              nucleotide compositions, Red located repeats with high
              sensitivities and maintained moderate false positive rates. Red
              outperformed the related tools on a bacterial genome. Red
              identified 46,405 novel repetitive segments in the human genome.
              Finally, Red is capable of processing assembled and unassembled
              genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Red's innovative methodology and its
              excellent performance on seven different genomes represent a

              interactions, current on-line resources rarely provide a direct
              mapping from structure to function at the domain level. Since the

              the Convolutional Neural Networks, with the patristic distance
              defined on the phylogenetic tree being used as the proximity

              together with a sparsified version of MultiDimensional Scaling to
              embed the phylogenetic tree in a Euclidean space. RESULTS: Ph-CNN

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Evolutionary histories can be discordant across the
              genome, and such discordances need to be considered in
              reconstructing the species phylogeny. ASTRAL is one of the
              leading methods for inferring species trees from gene trees while
              accounting for gene tree discordance. ASTRAL uses dynamic
              programming to search for the tree that shares the maximum number
              of quartet topologies with input gene trees, restricting itself
              to a predefined set of bipartitions. RESULTS: We introduce
              ASTRAL-III, which substantially improves the running time of
              ASTRAL-II and guarantees polynomial running time as a function of
              both the number of species (n) and the number of genes (k).
              ASTRAL-III limits the bipartition constraint set (X) to grow at
              most linearly with n and k. Moreover, it handles polytomies more
              efficiently than ASTRAL-II, exploits similarities between gene
              trees better, and uses several techniques to avoid searching
              parts of the search space that are mathematically guaranteed not
              to include the optimal tree. The asymptotic running time of
              ASTRAL-III in the presence of polytomies is [Formula: see text]
              where D=O(nk) is the sum of degrees of all unique nodes in input
              trees. The running time improvements enable us to test whether
              contracting low support branches in gene trees improves the
              accuracy by reducing noise. In extensive simulations, we show
              that removing branches with very low support (e.g., below 10\%)
              improves accuracy while overly aggressive filtering is harmful.
              We observe on a biological avian phylogenomic dataset of 14K
              genes that contracting low support branches greatly improve
              results. CONCLUSIONS: ASTRAL-III is a faster version of the
              ASTRAL method for phylogenetic reconstruction and can scale up to
              10,000 species. With ASTRAL-III, low support branches can be
              removed, resulting in improved accuracy.",

              around the world threaten the efficacy of currently-used medical
              treatments and call for novel, innovative approaches to manage
              multi-drug resistant infections. Phage therapy, i.e., the use of
              viruses (phages) to specifically infect and kill bacteria during
              their life cycle, is one of the most promising alternatives to
              antibiotics. It is based on the correct matching between a target
              pathogenic bacteria and the therapeutic phage. Nevertheless,
              correctly matching them is a major challenge. Currently, there is
              no systematic method to efficiently predict whether
              phage-bacterium interactions exist and these pairs must be
              empirically tested in laboratory. Herein, we present our approach
              for developing a computational model able to predict whether a
              given phage-bacterium pair can interact based on their genome.
              RESULTS: Based on public data from GenBank and phagesDB.org, we
              collected more than a thousand positive phage-bacterium
              interactions with their complete genomes. In addition, we
              generated putative negative (i.e., non-interacting) pairs. We
              extracted, from the collected genomes, a set of informative
              features based on the distribution of predictive protein-protein
              interactions and on their primary structure (e.g. amino-acid
              frequency, molecular weight and chemical composition of each
              protein). With these features, we generated multiple candidate
              datasets to train our algorithms. On this base, we built
              predictive models exhibiting predictive performance of around
              90\% in terms of F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and
              accuracy, obtained on the test set with 10-fold cross-validation.
              CONCLUSION: These promising results reinforce the hypothesis that
              machine learning techniques may produce highly-predictive models
              accelerating the search of interacting phage-bacteria pairs.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent developments in sequencing technologies make
              it possible to obtain genome sequences from a large number of
              isolates in a very short time. Bayesian phylogenetic approaches
              can take advantage of these data by simultaneously inferring the
              phylogenetic tree, evolutionary timescale, and demographic
              parameters (such as population growth rates), while naturally
              integrating uncertainty in all parameters. Despite their
              desirable properties, Bayesian approaches can be computationally
              intensive, hindering their use for outbreak investigations
              involving genome data for a large numbers of pathogen isolates.
              An alternative to using full Bayesian inference is to use a
              hybrid approach, where the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary
              timescale are estimated first using maximum likelihood. Under
              this hybrid approach, demographic parameters are inferred from
              estimated trees instead of the sequence data, using maximum
              likelihood, Bayesian inference, or approximate Bayesian
              computation. This can vastly reduce the computational burden, but
              has the disadvantage of ignoring the uncertainty in the
              phylogenetic tree and evolutionary timescale. RESULTS: We
              compared the performance of a fully Bayesian and a hybrid method
              by analysing six whole-genome SNP data sets from a range of
              bacteria and simulations. The estimates from the two methods were
              very similar, suggesting that the hybrid method is a valid
              alternative for very large datasets. However, we also found that
              congruence between these methods is contingent on the presence of
              strong temporal structure in the data (i.e. clocklike behaviour),
              which is typically verified using a date-randomisation test in a
              Bayesian framework. To reduce the computational burden of this
              Bayesian test we implemented a date-randomisation test using a
              rapid maximum likelihood method, which has similar performance to
              its Bayesian counterpart. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid approaches can
              produce reliable inferences of evolutionary timescales and
              phylodynamic parameters in a fraction of the time required for
              fully Bayesian analyses. As such, they are a valuable alternative
              in outbreak studies involving a large number of isolates.",

  author   = "Kleiner, Manuel and Hooper, Lora V and Duerkop, Breck A",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Viruses are a significant component of the intestinal
              microbiota in mammals. In recent years, advances in sequencing
              technologies and data analysis techniques have enabled detailed
              metagenomic studies investigating intestinal viromes (collections
              of bacteriophage and eukaryotic viral nucleic acids) and their
              potential contributions to the ecology of the microbiota. An
              important component of virome studies is the isolation and
              purification of virus-like particles (VLPs) from intestinal
              contents or feces. Several methods have been applied to isolate
              VLPs from intestinal samples, yet to our knowledge, the
              efficiency and reproducibility between methods have not been
              explored. A rigorous evaluation of methods for VLP purification
              is critical as many studies begin to move from descriptive
              analyses of virus diversity to studies striving to quantitatively
              compare viral abundances across many samples. Therefore,
              reproducible VLP purification methods which allow for high sample
              throughput are needed. Here we compared and evaluated four
              methods for VLP purification using artificial intestinal
              microbiota samples of known bacterial and viral composition.
              RESULTS: We compared the following four methods of VLP
              purification from fecal samples: (i) filtration + DNase, (ii)
              dithiothreitol treatment + filtration + DNase, (iii) filtration +
              DNase + PEG precipitation and (iv) filtration + DNase + CsCl
              density gradient centrifugation. Three of the four tested methods
              worked well for VLP purification. We observed several differences
              between methods related to the removal efficiency of bacterial
              and host DNAs and biases against specific phages. In particular
              the CsCl density gradient centrifugation method, which is
              frequently used for VLP purification, was most efficient in
              removing host derived DNA, but also showed strong discrimination
              against specific phages and showed a lower reproducibility of
              quantitative results. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data we recommend
              the use of methods (i) or (ii) for large scale studies when
              quantitative comparison of viral abundances across samples is
              required. The CsCl density gradient centrifugation method, while
              being excellently suited to achieve highly purified samples, in
              our opinion, should be used with caution when performing
              quantitative studies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: PCR amplicon sequencing has been widely used as a
              targeted approach for both DNA and RNA sequence analysis. High
              multiplex PCR has further enabled the enrichment of hundreds of
              amplicons in one simple reaction. At the same time, the
              performance of PCR amplicon sequencing can be negatively affected
              by issues such as high duplicate reads, polymerase artifacts and
              PCR amplification bias. Recently researchers have made some good
              progress in addressing these shortcomings by incorporating
              molecular barcodes into PCR primer design. So far, most work has
              been demonstrated using one to a few pairs of primers, which
              limits the size of the region one can analyze. RESULTS: We
              developed a simple protocol, which enables the use of molecular
              barcodes in high multiplex PCR with hundreds of amplicons. Using
              this protocol and reference materials, we demonstrated the
              applications in accurate variant calling at very low fraction
              over a large region and in targeted RNA quantification. We also
              evaluated the protocol's utility in profiling FFPE samples.

              molecular barcodes in high multiplex PCR, with multiplex scale
              many times higher than earlier work. We showed that the new

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Improved DNA sequencing methods have transformed the
              field of genomics over the last decade. This has become possible
              due to the development of inexpensive short read sequencing
              technologies which have now resulted in three generations of
              sequencing platforms. More recently, a new fourth generation of
              Nanopore based single molecule sequencing technology, was
              developed based on MinION(\textregistered{}) sequencer which is
              portable, inexpensive and fast. It is capable of generating reads
              of length greater than 100 kb. Though it has many specific
              advantages, the two major limitations of the MinION reads are
              high error rates and the need for the development of downstream
              pipelines. The algorithms for error correction have already
              emerged, while development of pipelines is still at nascent
              stage. RESULTS: In this study, we benchmarked available assembler
              algorithms to find an appropriate framework that can efficiently
              assemble Nanopore sequenced reads. To address this, we employed
              genome-scale Nanopore sequenced datasets available for E. coli
              and yeast genomes respectively. In order to comprehensively
              evaluate multiple algorithmic frameworks, we included assemblers
              based on de Bruijn graphs (Velvet and ABySS), Overlap Layout
              Consensus (OLC) (Celera) and Greedy extension (SSAKE) approaches.
              We analyzed the quality, accuracy of the assemblies as well as
              the computational performance of each of the assemblers included
              in our benchmark. Our analysis unveiled that OLC-based algorithm,
              Celera, could generate a high quality assembly with ten times
              higher N50 \& mean contig values as well as one-fifth the number
              of total number of contigs compared to other tools. Celera was
              also found to exhibit an average genome coverage of 12 \% in E.
              coli dataset and 70 \% in Yeast dataset as well as relatively
              lesser run times. In contrast, de Bruijn graph based assemblers
              Velvet and ABySS generated the assemblies of moderate quality, in
              less time when there is no limitation on the memory allocation,
              while greedy extension based algorithm SSAKE generated an
              assembly of very poor quality but with genome coverage of 90 \%
              on yeast dataset. CONCLUSION: OLC can be considered as a
              favorable algorithmic framework for the development of assembler
              tools for Nanopore-based data, followed by de Bruijn based
              algorithms as they consume relatively less or similar run times
              as OLC-based algorithms for generating assembly, irrespective of
              the memory allocated for the task. However, few improvements must
              be made to the existing de Bruijn implementations in order to
              generate an assembly with reasonable quality. Our findings should
              help in stimulating the development of novel assemblers for
              handling Nanopore sequence data.",

              for genetic and genomic analyses. The first release of the peach
              genome (Peach v1.0) represented a high-quality WGS (Whole Genome
              Shotgun) chromosome-scale assembly with high contiguity (contig
              L50 214.2 kb), large portions of mapped sequences (96\%) and high

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The question of whether bacterial species objectively
              exist has long divided microbiologists. A major source of
              contention stems from the fact that bacteria regularly engage in
              horizontal gene transfer (HGT), making it difficult to ascertain
              relatedness and draw boundaries between taxa. A natural way to
              define taxa is based on exclusivity of relatedness, which applies
              when members of a taxon are more closely related to each other
              than they are to any outsider. It is largely unknown whether
              exclusive bacterial taxa exist when averaging over the genome or
              are rare due to rampant hybridization. RESULTS: Here, we analyze
              a collection of 701 genomes representing a wide variety of
              environmental isolates from the family Streptomycetaceae, whose
              members are competent at HGT. We find that the presence/absence
              of auxiliary genes in the pan-genome displays a hierarchical
              (tree-like) structure that correlates significantly with the
              genealogy of the core-genome. Moreover, we identified the
              existence of many exclusive taxa, although individual genes often
              contradict these taxa. These conclusions were supported by
              repeating the analysis on 1,586 genomes belonging to the genus
              Bacillus. However, despite confirming the existence of exclusive
              groups (taxa), we were unable to identify an objective threshold
              at which to assign the rank of species. CONCLUSIONS: The
              existence of bacterial taxa is justified by considering average
              relatedness across the entire genome, as captured by exclusivity,
              but is rejected if one requires unanimous agreement of all parts
              of the genome. We propose using exclusivity to delimit taxa and
              conventional genome similarity thresholds to assign bacterial
              taxa to the species rank. This approach recognizes species that
              are phylogenetically meaningful, while also establishing some
              degree of comparability across species-ranked taxa in different
              bacterial clades.",

  title    = "Correlating enzyme annotations with a large set of microbial
              growth temperatures reveals metabolic adaptations to growth at
              diverse temperatures",
  author   = "Engqvist, Martin K M",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The ambient temperature of all habitats is a key
              physical property that shapes the biology of microbes inhabiting
              them. The optimal growth temperature (OGT) of a microbe, is
              therefore a key piece of data needed to understand evolutionary
              adaptations manifested in their genome sequence. Unfortunately
              there is no growth temperature database or easily downloadable
              dataset encompassing the majority of cultured microorganisms. We
              are thus limited in interpreting genomic data to identify
              temperature adaptations in microbes. RESULTS: In this work I
              significantly contribute to closing this gap by mining data from
              major culture collection centres to obtain growth temperature
              data for a nonredundant set of 21,498 microbes. The dataset (
              https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1175608 ) contains mainly bacteria
              and archaea and spans psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles and
              hyperthermophiles. Using this data a full 43\% of all protein
              entries in the UniProt database can be annotated with the growth
              temperature of the species from which they originate. I validate
              the dataset by showing a Pearson correlation of up to 0.89
              between growth temperature and mean enzyme optima, a
              physiological property directly influenced by the growth
              temperature. Using the temperature dataset I correlate the
              genomic occurance of enzyme functional annotations with growth
              temperature. I identify 319 enzyme functions that either increase
              or decrease in occurrence with temperature. Eight metabolic
              pathways were statistically enriched for these enzyme functions.
              Furthermore, I establish a correlation between 33 domains of
              unknown function (DUFs) with growth temperature in microbes, four
              of which (DUF438, DUF1524, DUF1957 and DUF3458\_C) were
              significant in both archaea and bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The growth
              temperature dataset enables large-scale correlation analysis with
              enzyme function- and domain-level annotations. Growth-temperature
              dependent changes in their occurrence highlight potential
              evolutionary adaptations. A few of the identified changes are
              previously known, such as the preference for menaquinone
              biosynthesis through the futalosine pathway in bacteria growing
              at high temperatures. Others represent important starting points
              for future studies, such as DUFs where their occurrence change
              with temperature. The growth temperature dataset should become a
              valuable community resource and will find additional, important,
              uses in correlating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic,
              metabolomic, phenotypic or taxonomic properties with temperature

              become available at ever increasing rates in response to the
              rapid progress in sequencing technologies. As a consequence the
              demand for methods supporting comparative, evolutionary analysis
              is also growing. In particular, efficient tools to
              visualize-omics data simultaneously for multiple species are
              sorely lacking. A first and crucial step in this direction is the
              construction of a common coordinate system. Since genomes not
              only differ by rearrangements but also by large insertions,
              deletions, and duplications, the use of a single reference genome
              is insufficient, in particular when the number of species becomes
              large. Results: The computational problem then becomes to
              determine an order and orientations of optimal local alignments
              that are as co-linear as possible with all the genome sequences.
              We first review the most prominent approaches to model the
              problem formally and then proceed to showing that it can be

              resistance arose around this period, when the mecA gene encoding
              methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec element, was
              horizontally transferred to an intrinsically sensitive strain of
              S. aureus. RESULTS: Whole genome sequencing a collection of the
              first MRSA isolates allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary
              history of the archetypal MRSA. We apply Bayesian phylogenetic
              reconstruction to infer the time point at which this early MRSA
              lineage arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the
              mid-1940s, following the acquisition of an ancestral type I
              SCCmec element, some 14 years before the first therapeutic use of
              methicillin. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin use was not the original
              driving factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought.
              Rather it was the widespread use of first generation beta-lactams
              such as penicillin in the years prior to the introduction of
              methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the
              mecA determinant. Crucially this highlights how new drugs,
              introduced to circumvent known resistance mechanisms, can be
              rendered ineffective by unrecognised adaptations in the bacterial
              population due to the historic selective landscape created by the
              widespread use of other antibiotics.",

              method to build taxonomy by analyzing the pan-genome composition
              of different species of the Klebsiella genus. Klebsiella species

              epigenetic gene regulation. While much attention has been focused
              on the classical epigenetic mark, 5-methylcytosine, the field
              garnered increased interest through the recent discovery of
              additional modifications. In this review, we focus on the
              epigenetic regulatory roles of DNA modifications in animals. We
              present the symmetric modification of 5-methylcytosine on CpG
              dinucleotide as a key feature, because it permits the inheritance
              of methylation patterns through DNA replication. However, the
              distribution patterns of cytosine methylation are not conserved
              in animals and independent molecular functions will likely be
              identified. Furthermore, the discovery of enzymes that catalyse
              the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
              not only identified an active demethylation pathway, but also a
              candidate for a new epigenetic mark associated with activated
              transcription. Most recently, N6-methyladenine was described as
              an additional eukaryotic DNA modification with epigenetic
              regulatory potential. Interestingly, this modification is also
              present in genomes that lack canonical cytosine methylation
              patterns, suggesting independent functions. This newfound
              diversity of DNA modifications and their potential for

              significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB)
              requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients.
              Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy
              and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study
              aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB
              suspects in northeastern Tanzania. METHODS: A cross-sectional

              Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from

              in five isolates not identified by GenoType(\textregistered{})

              role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in
              endemic settings. GenoType(\textregistered{}) Mycobacterium CM/AS
              represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections.
              However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for
              confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the
              complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend
              diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and
              setting up quality national and regional infrastructure.",

              2008 and 2014. Methods: We selected a representative subset of
              107 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates
              possessing the four most prevalent carbapenemase types in Germany
              (KPC-2, KPC-3, OXA-48, NDM-1). Isolates were processed via
              illumina NGS. Data were analysed using different SNP-based
              mapping and de-novo assembly approaches. Relevant information was
              extracted from NGS data (antibiotic resistance determinants, wzi
              gene/cps type, virulence genes). NGS data from the present study
              were also compared with 238 genome data from two previous
              international studies on K. pneumoniae. Results: NGS-based
              analyses revealed a preferred prevalence of KPC-2-producing ST258
              and KPC-3-producing ST512 isolates. OXA-48, being the most
              prevalent carbapenemase type in Germany, was associated with
              various K. pneumoniae strain types; most of them possessing
              IncL/M plasmid replicons suggesting a preferred dissemination of
              blaOXA-48 via this well-known plasmid type. Clusters ST15, ST147,
              ST258, and ST512 demonstrated an intermingled subset structure
              consisting of German and other European K. pneumoniae isolates.
              ST23 being the most frequent MLST type in Asia was found only
              once in Germany. This latter isolate contained an almost complete
              set of virulence genes and a K1 capsule suggesting occurrence of
              a hypervirulent ST23 strain producing OXA-48 in Germany.
              Conclusions: Our study results suggest prevalence of
              ``classical'' K. pneumonaie strain types associated with widely
              distributed carbapenemase genes such as ST258/KPC-2 or

              hypervirulent and OXA-48-producing ST23 K. pneumoniae isolates

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Data from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon
              sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical
              interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over
              several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros.
              Although we are typically interested in comparing relative
              abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can
              only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained
              from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative
              abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of
              taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a
              special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa
              in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are
              compositional data. Because the compositional data are
              constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained
              in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not
              applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the
              performance of existing normalization methods and differential
              abundance analyses. RESULTS: Effects on normalization: Most
              normalization methods enable successful clustering of samples
              according to biological origin when the groups differ
              substantially in their overall microbial composition. Rarefying
              more clearly clusters samples according to biological origin than
              other normalization techniques do for ordination metrics based on
              presence or absence. Alternate normalization measures are
              potentially vulnerable to artifacts due to library size. Effects
              on differential abundance testing: We build on a previous work to
              evaluate seven proposed statistical methods using rarefied as
              well as raw data. Our simulation studies suggest that the false
              discovery rates of many differential abundance-testing methods
              are not increased by rarefying itself, although of course
              rarefying results in a loss of sensitivity due to elimination of
              a portion of available data. For groups with large (~10$\times$)
              differences in the average library size, rarefying lowers the
              false discovery rate. DESeq2, without addition of a constant,
              increased sensitivity on smaller datasets (20 samples per group)
              but also critically the only method tested that has a good
              control of false discovery rate. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
              guide which normalization and differential abundance techniques
              to use based on the data characteristics of a given study.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Identifying viral sequences in mixed metagenomes
               containing both viral and host contigs is a critical first step
               in analyzing the viral component of samples. Current tools for
               distinguishing prokaryotic virus and host contigs primarily use
               gene-based similarity approaches. Such approaches can
               significantly limit results especially for short contigs that
               have few predicted proteins or lack proteins with similarity to
               previously known viruses. METHODS: We have developed VirFinder,
               the first k-mer frequency based, machine learning method for
               virus contig identification that entirely avoids gene-based
               similarity searches. VirFinder instead identifies viral
               sequences based on our empirical observation that viruses and
               hosts have discernibly different k-mer signatures. VirFinder's
               performance in correctly identifying viral sequences was tested
               by training its machine learning model on sequences from host
               and viral genomes sequenced before 1 January 2014 and evaluating
               on sequences obtained after 1 January 2014. RESULTS: VirFinder
               had significantly better rates of identifying true viral contigs
               (true positive rates (TPRs)) than VirSorter, the current
               state-of-the-art gene-based virus classification tool, when
               evaluated with either contigs subsampled from complete genomes
               or assembled from a simulated human gut metagenome. For example,
               for contigs subsampled from complete genomes, VirFinder had 78-,
               2.4-, and 1.8-fold higher TPRs than VirSorter for 1, 3, and 5 kb
               contigs, respectively, at the same false positive rates as
               VirSorter (0, 0.003, and 0.006, respectively), thus VirFinder
               works considerably better for small contigs than VirSorter.
               VirFinder furthermore identified several recently sequenced
               virus genomes (after 1 January 2014) that VirSorter did not and
               that have no nucleotide similarity to previously sequenced
               viruses, demonstrating VirFinder's potential advantage in
               identifying novel viral sequences. Application of VirFinder to a
               set of human gut metagenomes from healthy and liver cirrhosis
               patients reveals higher viral diversity in healthy individuals
               than cirrhosis patients. We also identified contig bins
               containing crAssphage-like contigs with higher abundance in
               healthy patients and a putative Veillonella genus prophage
               associated with cirrhosis patients. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative
               k-mer based tool complements gene-based approaches and will
               significantly improve prokaryotic viral sequence identification,
               especially for metagenomic-based studies of viral ecology.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Sequence-specific PCR is the most common approach for
              virus identification in diagnostic laboratories. However, as
              specific PCR only detects pre-defined targets, novel virus
              strains or viruses not included in routine test panels will be
              missed. Recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing allow
              for virus-sequence-independent identification of entire virus
              populations in clinical samples, yet standardized protocols are
              needed to allow broad application in clinical diagnostics. Here,
              we describe a comprehensive sample preparation protocol for
              high-throughput metagenomic virus sequencing using random
              amplification of total nucleic acids from clinical samples.
              RESULTS: In order to optimize metagenomic sequencing for
              application in virus diagnostics, we tested different enrichment
              and amplification procedures on plasma samples spiked with RNA
              and DNA viruses. A protocol including filtration, nuclease
              digestion, and random amplification of RNA and DNA in separate
              reactions provided the best results, allowing reliable recovery
              of viral genomes and a good correlation of the relative number of
              sequencing reads with the virus input. We further validated our
              method by sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagent
              containing a range of human viruses from different virus
              families. Our method proved successful in detecting the majority
              of the included viruses with high read numbers and compared well
              to other protocols in the field validated against the same
              reference reagent. Our sequencing protocol does work not only
              with plasma but also with other clinical samples such as urine
              and throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The workflow for virus metagenomic
              sequencing that we established proved successful in detecting a
              variety of viruses in different clinical samples. Our protocol
              supplements existing virus-specific detection strategies

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An approach utilizing the long-read capability of the
              Oxford Nanopore MinION to rapidly sequence bacterial ribosomal
              operons of complex natural communities was developed. Microbial
              fingerprinting employs domain-specific forward primers (16S rRNA
              subunit), reverse primers (23S rRNA subunit), and a high-fidelity
              Taq polymerase with proofreading capabilities. Amplicons
              contained both ribosomal subunits for broad-based phylogenetic
              assignment (~ 3900 bp of sequence), plus the intergenic spacer
              (ITS) region (~ 300 bp) for potential strain-specific
              identification. RESULTS: To test the approach, bacterial rRNA
              operons (~ 4200 bp) were amplified from six DNA samples employing
              a mixture of farm soil and bioreactor DNA in known
              concentrations. Each DNA sample mixture was barcoded, sequenced
              in quadruplicate (n = 24), on two separate 6-h runs using the
              MinION system (R7.3 flow cell; MAP005 and 006 chemistry). From
              nearly 90,000 MinION reads, roughly 33,000 forward and reverse
              sequences were obtained. This yielded over 10,000 2D sequences
              which were analyzed using a simplified data analysis pipeline
              based on NCBI Blast and assembly with Geneious software. The
              method could detect over 1000 operational taxonomic units in the
              sample sets in a quantitative manner. Global sequence coverage
              for the various rRNA operons ranged from 1 to 1951x. An iterative
              assembly scheme was developed to reconstruct those rRNA operons
              with > 35x coverage from a set of 30 operational taxonomic units
              (OTUs) among the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria,
              Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes. Phylogenetic analysis of the
              16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes from each operon demonstrated similar
              tree topologies with species/strain-level resolution.
              CONCLUSIONS: This sequencing method represents a cost-effective
              way to profile microbial communities. Because the MinION is
              small, portable, and runs on a laptop, the possibility of
              microbiota characterization in the field or on robotic platforms

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Profiling of shotgun metagenomic samples is hindered
              by a lack of unified microbial reference genome databases that
              (i) assemble genomic information from all open access microbial
              genomes, (ii) have relatively small sizes, and (iii) are
              compatible to various metagenomic read mapping tools. Moreover,
              computational tools to rapidly compile and update such databases
              to accommodate the rapid increase in new reference genomes do not
              exist. As a result, database-guided analyses often fail to
              profile a substantial fraction of metagenomic shotgun sequencing
              reads from complex microbiomes. RESULTS: We report pipelines that
              efficiently traverse all open access microbial genomes and
              assemble non-redundant genomic information. The pipelines result
              in two species-resolution microbial reference databases of
              relatively small sizes: reprDB, which assembles microbial
              representative or reference genomes, and panDB, for which we
              developed a novel iterative alignment algorithm to identify and
              assemble non-redundant genomic regions in multiple sequenced
              strains. With the databases, we managed to assign taxonomic
              labels and genome positions to the majority of metagenomic reads
              from human skin and gut microbiomes, demonstrating a significant
              improvement over a previous database-guided analysis on the same

              increases in the number of open access microbial genomes to more
              fully profile metagenomic samples. Additionally, the databases
              exclude redundant sequence information to avoid inflated storage
              or memory space and indexing or analyzing time. Finally, the
              novel iterative alignment algorithm significantly increases
              efficiency in pan-genome identification and can be useful in

              techniques now allow for obtaining genome sequences of
              uncultivated prokaryotic taxa, facilitating in-depth analyses
              that may ultimately improve our understanding of these key
              organisms. RESULTS: We compared results from two
              culture-independent strategies for recovering bacterial genomes:
              single-amplified genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes.
              Single-amplified genomes were obtained from samples collected at
              an offshore station in the Baltic Sea Proper and compared to
              previously obtained metagenome-assembled genomes from a time
              series at the same station. Among 16 single-amplified genomes
              analyzed, seven were found to match metagenome-assembled genomes,
              affiliated with a diverse set of taxa. Notably, genome pairs
              between the two approaches were nearly identical (average 99.51\%
              sequence identity; range 98.77-99.84\%) across overlapping
              regions (30-80\% of each genome). Within matching pairs, the
              single-amplified genomes were consistently smaller and less
              complete, whereas the genetic functional profiles were
              maintained. For the metagenome-assembled genomes, only on average
              3.6\% of the bases were estimated to be missing from the genomes
              due to wrongly binned contigs. CONCLUSIONS: The strong agreement
              between the single-amplified and metagenome-assembled genomes
              emphasizes that both methods generate accurate genome information
              from uncultivated bacteria. Importantly, this implies that the
              research questions and the available resources are allowed to
              determine the selection of genomics approach for microbiome
              studies.",

  abstract = "The study of microbial pangenomes relies on the computation of
              gene families, i.e. the clustering of coding sequences into
              groups of essentially similar genes. There is no standard
              approach to obtain such gene families. Ideally, the gene family
              computations should be robust against errors in the annotation of
              genes in various genomes. In an attempt to achieve this
              robustness, we propose to cluster sequences by their domain
              sequence, i.e. the ordered sequence of domains in their protein
              sequence. In a study of 347 genomes from Escherichia coli we find
              on average around 4500 proteins having hits in Pfam-A in every
              genome, clustering into around 2500 distinct domain sequence
              families in each genome. Across all genomes we find a total of
              5724 such families. A binomial mixture model approach indicates
              this is around 95\% of all domain sequences we would expect to
              see in E. coli in the future. A Heaps law analysis indicates the
              population of domain sequences is larger, but this analysis is
              also very sensitive to smaller changes in the computation
              procedure. The resolution between strains is good despite the
              coarse grouping obtained by domain sequence families. Clustering
              sequences by their ordered domain content give us domain sequence
              families, who are robust to errors in the gene prediction step.
              The computational load of the procedure scales linearly with the
              number of genomes, which is needed for the future explosion in
              the number of re-sequenced strains. The use of domain sequence
              families for a functional classification of strains clearly has
              some potential to be explored.",

  abstract = "Following a nanopore sequencing run of PCR products of three
              amplicons less than 1kb, an abundance of reads failed quality
              control due to template/complement mismatch. A BLAST search
              demonstrated that some of the failed reads mapped to two
              different genes -- an unexpected observation, given that PCR was
              carried out separately for each amplicon. A further investigation
              was carried out specifically to search for chimeric reads, using
              separate barcodes for each amplicon and trying two different
              ligation methods prior to sample loading. Despite the separation
              of ligation products, chimeric reads formed from different

              long-read nature of nanopore sequencing presents an effective
              tool for the discovery and filtering of chimeric reads. We have

              given bacterium, based on genome sequence alone would be of value
              for scientific as well as industrial purposes. One example of
              such a habitat adaptation is the requirement for oxygen. In spite
              of good genome data availability, there have been only a few
              prediction attempts of bacterial oxygen requirements, using
              genome sequences. Here, we describe a method for distinguishing
              aerobic, anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, based on
              genome sequence-derived input, using naive Bayesian inference. In
              contrast, other studies found in literature only demonstrate the
              ability to distinguish two classes at a time. RESULTS: The
              results shown in the present study are as good as or better than
              comparable methods previously described in the scientific
              literature, with an arguably simpler method, when results are
              directly compared. This method further compares the performance
              of a single-step naive Bayesian prediction of the three included
              classifications, compared to a simple Bayesian network with two
              steps. A two-step network, distinguishing first respiring from
              non-respiring organisms, followed by the distinction of aerobe
              and facultative anaerobe organisms within the respiring group, is
              found to perform best. CONCLUSIONS: A simple naive Bayesian
              network based on the presence or absence of specific protein
              domains within a genome is an effective and easy way to predict
              bacterial habitat preferences, such as oxygen requirement.",

              chronic venous leg ulcers (VLUs); 39 patients completed the
              trial. The ulcers were treated for 12 weeks with either a saline

              aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Follow-up
              continued until week 24. RESULTS: No adverse events were
              attributed to the study product. No significant difference

              analyzed the organization of photosynthetic (PS) complexes in the
              bacterium G. phototrophica, which so far is the only phototrophic
              representative of the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes. The
              isolated complex has a molecular weight of about 800 $\pm$ 100
              kDa, which is approximately 2 times larger than the core complex
              of Rhodospirillum rubrum. The complex contains 62.4 $\pm$ 4.7
              bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a molecules absorbing in 2 distinct
              infrared absorption bands with maxima at 816 and 868 nm. Using
              femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we determined the
              energy transfer time between these spectral bands as 2 ps. Single
              particle analyses of the purified complexes showed that they were
              circular structures with an outer diameter of approximately 18 nm
              and a thickness of 7 nm. Based on the obtained, we propose that
              the light-harvesting complexes in G. phototrophica form 2
              concentric rings surrounding the type 2 RC. The inner ring
              (corresponding to the B868 absorption band) is composed of 15
              subunits and is analogous to the inner light-harvesting complex 1
              (LH1) in purple bacteria. The outer ring is composed of 15 more
              distant BChl dimers with no or slow energy transfer between them,
              resulting in the B816 absorption band. This completely unique and
              elegant organization offers good structural stability, as well as
              high efficiency of light harvesting. Our results reveal that
              while the PS apparatus of Gemmatimonadetes was acquired via
              horizontal gene transfer from purple bacteria, it later evolved
              along its own pathway, devising a new arrangement of its light

              profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational
              expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an
              acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the ``multiple segment
              Viterbi'' (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal
              sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped
              vector-parallel approach previously described for fast
              Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical
              distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing
              rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus
              facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a
              20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward
              algorithms using a method I call ``sparse rescaling''. These
              methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV
              hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM
              Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is
              implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package.
              Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV
              filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to
              unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more
              sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now

              error-free full-length haplotypes from low coverage samples and
              detect large insertions and deletions at low frequencies. We

              to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the
              BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the
              lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully
              developed package management system that allows third party
              developers to write additional functionality that can be directly
              installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager
              without requiring a new software release of the platform. This
              package architecture is showcased with a number of recently
              published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree
              priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models

              BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support
              for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally,
              the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user
              interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism
              because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater
              integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so

              microorganism is important in industrial and clinical
              applications where close relationships imply similar treatment.
              Microbial classification based on similarity of physiological and
              genetic organism traits (polyphasic similarity) is experimentally
              difficult and, arguably, subjective. Evolutionary relatedness,
              inferred from phylogenetic markers, facilitates classification
              but does not guarantee functional identity between members of the
              same taxon or lack of similarity between different taxa. Using
              over thirteen hundred sequenced bacterial genomes, we built a
              novel function-based microorganism classification scheme,
              functional-repertoire similarity-based organism network (FuSiON;
              flattened to fusion). Our scheme is phenetic, based on a network
              of quantitatively defined organism relationships across the known
              prokaryotic space. It correlates significantly with the current
              taxonomy, but the observed discrepancies reveal both (1) the
              inconsistency of functional diversity levels among different taxa
              and (2) an (unsurprising) bias towards prioritizing, for
              classification purposes, relatively minor traits of particular
              interest to humans. Our dynamic network-based organism
              classification is independent of the arbitrary pairwise organism
              similarity cut-offs traditionally applied to establish taxonomic
              identity. Instead, it reveals natural, functionally defined
              organism groupings and is thus robust in handling organism
              diversity. Additionally, fusion can use organism meta-data to
              highlight the specific environmental factors that drive microbial
              diversification. Our approach provides a complementary view to
              cladistic assignments and holds important clues for further
              exploration of microbial lifestyles. Fusion is a more practical
              fit for biomedical, industrial, and ecological applications, as
              many of these rely on understanding the functional capabilities

              features presents new challenges, and validated computational

              questions about the generality and generalization of
              disease-predictive models across cohorts. In this paper, we
              comprehensively assess approaches to metagenomics-based
              prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength
              of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop a
              computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative
              microbiome profiles, including species-level relative abundances
              and presence of strain-specific markers. A comprehensive
              meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization across
              cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available
              metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies.
              Cross-validation revealed good disease-prediction capabilities,
              which were in general improved by feature selection and use of
              strain-specific markers instead of species-level taxonomic
              abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between
              studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by
              within-study cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of
              healthy (control) samples from other studies to training sets
              improved disease prediction capabilities. Some microbial species
              (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize
              general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than
              connections with a specific disease. Our results in modelling

              in a human sample. However, complete and accurate
              characterization of the sequence, including identification of any
              pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for
              comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these
              numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis

              host organisms for the renewable synthesis of chemical bulk
              products from atmospheric CO2. The cyanobacterial phylum exhibits
              enormous metabolic diversity with respect to morphology,
              lifestyle and habitat. As yet, however, research has mostly
              focused on few model strains and cyanobacterial diversity is
              insufficiently understood. In this respect, the increasing
              availability of fully sequenced bacterial genomes opens new and
              unprecedented opportunities to investigate the genetic inventory
              of organisms in the context of their pan-genome. Here, we seek
              understand cyanobacterial diversity using a comparative genome
              analysis of 77 fully sequenced and assembled cyanobacterial
              genomes. We use phylogenetic profiling to analyze the
              co-occurrence of clusters of likely ortholog genes (CLOGs) and
              reveal novel functional associations between CLOGs that are not
              captured by co-localization of genes. Going beyond pair-wise
              co-occurrences, we propose a network approach that allows us to
              identify modules of co-occurring CLOGs. The extracted modules
              exhibit a high degree of functional coherence and reveal known as
              well as previously unknown functional associations. We argue that
              the high functional coherence observed for the modules is a
              consequence of the similar-yet-diverse nature of cyanobacteria.
              Our approach highlights the importance of a multi-strain analysis
              to understand gene functions and environmental adaptations, with

              (HCV) RNA is integral to diagnostic and therapeutic regimens. All
              molecular assays target the viral 5'-noncoding region (5'-NCR),
              and all show genotype-dependent variation of sensitivities and
              viral load results. Non-western HCV genotypes have been
              under-represented in evaluation studies. An alternative
              diagnostic target region within the HCV genome could facilitate a
              new generation of assays. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study we
              determined by de novo sequencing that the 3'-X-tail element,
              characterized significantly later than the rest of the genome, is
              highly conserved across genotypes. To prove its clinical utility
              as a molecular diagnostic target, a prototype qualitative and
              quantitative test was developed and evaluated multicentrically on
              a large and complete panel of 725 clinical plasma samples,
              covering HCV genotypes 1-6, from four continents (Germany, UK,
              Brazil, South Africa, Singapore). To our knowledge, this is the
              most diversified and comprehensive panel of clinical and genotype
              specimens used in HCV nucleic acid testing (NAT) validation to
              date. The lower limit of detection (LOD) was 18.4 IU/ml (95\%
              confidence interval, 15.3-24.1 IU/ml), suggesting applicability
              in donor blood screening. The upper LOD exceeded 10(-9) IU/ml,
              facilitating viral load monitoring within a wide dynamic range.
              In 598 genotyped samples, quantified by Bayer VERSANT 3.0
              branched DNA (bDNA), X-tail-based viral loads were highly
              concordant with bDNA for all genotypes. Correlation coefficients
              between bDNA and X-tail NAT, for genotypes 1-6, were: 0.92, 0.85,
              0.95, 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; X-tail-based viral
              loads deviated by more than 0.5 log10 from 5'-NCR-based viral
              loads in only 12\% of samples (maximum deviation, 0.85 log10).
              The successful introduction of X-tail NAT in a Brazilian
              laboratory confirmed the practical stability and robustness of
              the X-tail-based protocol. The assay was implemented at low
              reaction costs (US\$8.70 per sample), short turnover times (2.5 h
              for up to 96 samples), and without technical difficulties.
              CONCLUSION: This study indicates a way to fundamentally improve
              HCV viral load monitoring and infection screening. Our prototype
              assay can serve as a template for a new generation of viral load
              assays. Additionally, to our knowledge this study provides the
              first open protocol to permit industry-grade HCV detection and

              agents and assess the feasibility of this approach in
              diagnostics. METHODOLOGY: An ultrahigh-multiplex panel was
              designed with primers to amplify all known variants of
              VHF-associated viruses and relevant controls. The performance of
              the panel was evaluated via serially quantified nucleic acids
              from Yellow fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo
              hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, Ebola virus, Junin virus and
              Chikungunya virus in a semiconductor-based sequencing platform. A
              comparison of direct NGS and targeted amplification-NGS was
              performed. The panel was further tested via a real-time nanopore
              sequencing-based platform, using clinical specimens from CCHF
              patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The multiplex primer panel
              comprises two pools of 285 and 256 primer pairs for the
              identification of 46 virus species causing hemorrhagic fevers,
              encompassing 6,130 genetic variants of the strains involved. In
              silico validation revealed that the panel detected over 97\% of
              all known genetic variants of the targeted virus species. High
              levels of specificity and sensitivity were observed for the
              tested virus strains. Targeted amplification ensured viral read
              detection in specimens with the lowest virus concentration (1-10
              genome equivalents) and enabled significant increases in specific
              reads over background for all viruses investigated. In clinical
              specimens, the panel enabled detection of the causative agent and
              its characterization within 10 minutes of sequencing, with
              sample-to-result time of less than 3.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Virus
              enrichment via targeted amplification followed by NGS is an
              applicable strategy for the diagnosis of VHFs which can be
              adapted for high-throughput or nanopore sequencing platforms and

              FINDINGS: Using the 23S rRNA gene as an example, we analyzed the
              diversity among individual rRNA genes within a genome. Of 184
              prokaryotic species containing multiple 23S rRNA genes, diversity
              was observed in 113 (61.4\%) genomes (mean 0.40\%, range
              0.01\%-4.04\%). Significant (1.17\%-4.04\%) intragenomic
              variation was found in 8 species. In 5 of the 8 species, the
              diversity in the primary structure had only minimal effect on the
              secondary structure (stem versus loop transition). In the
              remaining 3 species, the diversity significantly altered local
              secondary structure, but the alteration appears minimized through
              complex rearrangement. Intervening sequences (IVS), ranging
              between 9 and 1471 nt in size, were found in 7 species. IVS in
              Deinococcus radiodurans and Nostoc sp. encode transposases. T.

              improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Where FastTree 1 used
              nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution
              criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution
              subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs.
              FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better
              trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the
              ``CAT'' approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and
              genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a
              standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with
              default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate
              as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits
              that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments,
              FastTree 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a

  abstract  = "Background Massively parallel sequencing systems continue to
               improve on data output, while leaving labor-intensive library
               preparations a potential bottleneck. Efforts are currently under
               way to relieve the crucial and time-consuming work to prepare
               DNA for high-throughput sequencing. Methodology/Principal
               Findings In this study, we demonstrate an automated parallel
               library preparation protocol using generic carboxylic
               acid-coated superparamagnetic beads and polyethylene glycol
               precipitation as a reproducible and flexible method for DNA
               fragment length separation. With this approach the library
               preparation for DNA sequencing can easily be adjusted to a
               desired fragment length. The automated protocol, here
               demonstrated using the GS FLX Titanium instrument, was compared
               to the standard manual library preparation, showing higher
               yield, throughput and great reproducibility. In addition, 12
               libraries were prepared and uniquely tagged in parallel, and the
               distribution of sequence reads between these indexed samples
               could be improved using quantitative PCR-assisted pooling.
               Conclusions/Significance We present a novel automated procedure
               that makes it possible to prepare 36 indexed libraries per
               person and day, which can be increased to up to 96 libraries
               processed simultaneously. The yield, speed and robust
               performance of the protocol constitute a substantial improvement
               to present manual methods, without the need of extensive
               equipment investments. The described procedure enables a
               considerable efficiency increase for small to midsize sequencing

              is a virus discovery method based on recognition of restriction
              enzyme cleavage sites, ligation of adaptors and subsequent
              amplification by PCR. However, direct discovery of unknown
              pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs is difficult due to the high
              concentration of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) that acts as competitor. In
              the current study we optimized VIDISCA by adjusting the reverse
              transcription enzymes and decreasing rRNA amplification in the
              reverse transcription, using hexamer oligonucleotides that do not
              anneal to rRNA. Residual cDNA synthesis on rRNA templates was
              further reduced with oligonucleotides that anneal to rRNA but can
              not be extended due to 3'-dideoxy-C6-modification. With these

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The 16S rRNA gene is the gold standard in molecular
              surveys of bacterial and archaeal diversity, but it has the
              disadvantages that it is often multiple-copy, has little
              resolution below the species level and cannot be readily
              interpreted in an evolutionary framework. We compared the 16S
              rRNA marker with the single-copy, protein-coding rpoB marker by
              amplifying and sequencing both from a single soil sample. Because
              the higher genetic resolution of the rpoB gene prohibits its use
              as a universal marker, we employed consensus-degenerate primers
              targeting the Proteobacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Pyrosequencing can be problematic because of the poor resolution
              of homopolymer runs. As these erroneous runs disrupt the reading
              frame of protein-coding sequences, removal of sequences
              containing nonsense mutations was found to be a valuable filter
              in addition to flowgram-based denoising. Although both markers
              gave similar estimates of total diversity, the rpoB marker
              revealed more species, requiring an order of magnitude fewer
              reads to obtain 90\% of the true diversity. The application of
              population genetic methods was demonstrated on a particularly
              abundant sequence cluster. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The rpoB
              marker can be a complement to the 16S rRNA marker for high
              throughput microbial diversity studies focusing on specific

              diversity, including that associated with the human body. A
              fundamental challenge in using these approaches has been to
              isolate DNA that is representative of the microbial community
              sampled. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we
              statistically evaluated six commonly used DNA extraction
              procedures using eleven human-associated bacterial species and a
              mock community that contained equal numbers of those eleven
              species. These methods were compared on the basis of DNA yield,
              DNA shearing, reproducibility, and most importantly
              representation of microbial diversity. The analysis of 16S rRNA
              gene sequences from a mock community showed that the observed
              species abundances were significantly different from the expected
              species abundances for all six DNA extraction methods used.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Protocols that included bead beating
              and/or mutanolysin produced significantly better bacterial
              community structure representation than methods without both of

              information is available about the diversity of viruses present
              in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, which was
              optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral
              particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and
              RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to
              deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The
              efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control
              consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with
              different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the
              bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was
              assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure.
              RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled faecal sample of
              five pigs. From this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were
              generated. All of the added bacteriophages were identified by
              sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7\% of the reads
              showed significant sequence identities with published viral
              sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9\%)
              and mammalian viruses (23.9\%); 0.8\% of the sequences showed
              identities to plant viruses. The most abundant detected porcine
              viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B,
              sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with
              identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA
              virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this
              virus, tentatively designated as pig stool-associated circular
              ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel pig virus. CONCLUSION:
              The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of
              DNA and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of
              so far unknown viruses. It may be applied in studies
              investigating aetiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases.
              The implemented process control serves as quality control,
              ensures comparability of the method and may be used for further

              Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, in a region of the cave that has
              been isolated for over 4 million years. We report that, like
              surface microbes, these bacteria were highly resistant to
              antibiotics; some strains were resistant to 14 different

               there have been no large-scale empirical evaluations of the
               major determinants of sequencing success. We used a combination

               from 1115 samples from 695 plant species in 324 families, which
               represents >900 million years of phylogenetic diversity from
               green algae through flowering plants, including many plants of
               economic importance. We then sequenced 629 of these samples on
               Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq platforms and performed a large
               comparative analysis to identify predictors of RNA quality and
               the diversity of putative genes (scaffolds) expressed within
               samples. Tissue types (e.g., leaf vs. flower) varied in RNA
               quality, sequencing depth and the number of scaffolds. Tissue
               age also influenced RNA quality but not the number of scaffolds
               $\geq$1000 bp. Overall, 36\% of the variation in the number of
               scaffolds was explained by metrics of RNA integrity (RIN score),
               RNA purity (OD 260/230), sequencing platform (GAIIx vs HiSeq)
               and the amount of total RNA used for sequencing. However, our
               results show that the most commonly used measures of RNA quality
               (e.g., RIN) are weak predictors of the number of scaffolds

               quality. These results provide novel insight into the methods

              processes waste from bulk drug production revealed the presence
              of a range of drugs, including broad spectrum antibiotics at
              extremely high concentrations (mg/L range). In this study, we
              have characterized the antibiotic resistance profiles of 93

              Enterococci (VRE), Aerococcus sp. and Citrobacter freundii were

               retrieval of k-mer counts in memory which is necessary to

               this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than
               any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min

              for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to
              biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec)
              for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec)
              for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in
              applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the
              present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized
              in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family
              classification, protein visualization, structure prediction,
              disordered protein identification, and protein-protein
              interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial
              neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a
              single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we
              apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained
              from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an
              average family classification accuracy of 93\%$\pm$0.06\% is
              obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods.
              In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered
              proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered
              sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database
              featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with
              phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector
              machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from
              structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
              with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are
              differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\%
              accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence
              data for various proteins into this model, accurate information
              about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this
              model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to
              extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of
              interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as
              pre-training for various applications of deep learning in

               humans as novel strains occasionally emerge from the avian
               population to cause human infections. Many past epidemic as well
               as pandemic strains have originated from avian species. While
               most viruses are restricted to their primary hosts, zoonotic
               strains can sometimes arise from mutations or reassortment,
               leading them to acquire the capability to escape host species
               barrier and successfully infect a new host. Phylogenetic
               analyses and genetic markers are useful in tracing the origins
               of zoonotic infections, but there are still no effective means
               to identify high risk strains prior to an outbreak. Here we show
               that distinct host tropism protein signatures can be used to
               identify possible zoonotic strains in avian species which have
               the potential to cause human infections. We have discovered that
               influenza A viruses can now be classified into avian, human, or
               zoonotic strains based on their host tropism protein signatures.
               Analysis of all influenza A viruses with complete proteome using
               the host tropism prediction system, based on machine learning
               classifications of avian and human viral proteins has uncovered
               distinct signatures of zoonotic strains as mosaics of avian and
               human viral proteins. This is in contrast with typical avian or
               human strains where they show mostly avian or human viral
               proteins in their signatures respectively. Moreover, we have
               found that zoonotic strains from the same influenza outbreaks
               carry similar host tropism protein signatures characteristic of
               a common ancestry. Our results demonstrate that the distinct
               host tropism protein signature in zoonotic strains may prove
               useful in influenza surveillance to rapidly identify potential
               high risk strains circulating in avian species, which may grant

              in biocontrol and biofertilization. So far the phylogeny of this
              complex has been analyzed according to phenotypic traits, 16S
              rDNA, MLSA and inferred by whole-genome analysis. However, since
              most of the type strains have not been fully sequenced and new
              species are frequently described, correlation between taxonomy
              and phylogenomic analysis is missing. In recent years, the
              genomes of a large number of strains have been sequenced, showing
              important genomic heterogeneity and providing information
              suitable for genomic studies that are important to understand the
              genomic and genetic diversity shown by strains of this complex.
              Based on MLSA and several whole-genome sequence-based analyses of
              93 sequenced strains, we have divided the P. fluorescens complex
              into eight phylogenomic groups that agree with previous works
              based on type strains. Digital DDH (dDDH) identified 69 species
              and 75 subspecies within the 93 genomes. The eight groups
              corresponded to clustering with a threshold of 31.8\% dDDH, in
              full agreement with our MLSA. The Average Nucleotide Identity
              (ANI) approach showed inconsistencies regarding the assignment to
              species and to the eight groups. The small core genome of 1,334
              CDSs and the large pan-genome of 30,848 CDSs, show the large
              diversity and genetic heterogeneity of the P. fluorescens
              complex. However, a low number of strains were enough to explain
              most of the CDSs diversity at core and strain-specific genomic
              fractions. Finally, the identification and analysis of
              group-specific genome and the screening for distinctive
              characters revealed a phylogenomic distribution of traits among
              the groups that provided insights into biocontrol and

               nanopores can meet all these requirements, but to achieve high

               fabrication imperfections and to nanopore enlargement during
               operation. This paper presents a model for molecular engineering
               techniques that meets these goals with the aim of detecting
               target sequences within DNA. In contrast to methods that require

               types and a couple of variants have yet been described. In
               addition, there are also other SCC elements harbouring other
               markers. In order to subtype strains of methicillin-resistant S.
               aureus (MRSA) based on variations within their SCCmec elements,
               86 markers were selected from published SCC sequences for an
               assay based on multiplexed primer extension reactions followed
               by hybridisation to the specific probes. These included
               mecA/mecC, fusC, regulatory genes, recombinase genes, genes from
               ACME and heavy metal resistance loci as well as several genes of
               unknown function. Hybridisation patterns for published genome or
               SCC sequences were theoretically predicted. For validation of
               the microarray based assay and for stringent hybridisation
               protocol optimization, real hybridization experiments with fully
               sequenced reference strains were performed modifying protocols

               predictions. Subsequently, 226 clinical isolates from two
               hospitals in the city of Dresden, Germany, were characterised in
               detail. Beside previously described types and subtypes, a wide
               variety of additional SCC types or subtypes and pseudoSCC
               elements were observed as well as numerous composite elements.
               Within the study collection, 61 different such elements have
               been identified. Since hybridisation cannot recognise the
               localisation of target genes, gene duplications or inversions,
               this is a rather conservative estimate. Interestingly, some
               widespread epidemic strains engulf distinct variants with
               different SCCmec subtypes. Notable examples are ST239-MRSA-III,
               CC5-, CC22-, CC30-, and CC45-MRSA-IV or CC398-MRSA-V.

               strains with SCCmec IVa being spread among the highest number of

               distinguish isolates that appear similar or identical by other

               tool for the detection of putative new SCC types or variants
               that warrant further investigation and sequencing. The high
               degree of diversity of SCC elements even within so-called
               strains could be helpful for epidemiological typing. It also

              such genome, the total number of bases to be sequenced should be
              O(G ln G). Although the result leads to a tight bound, it is
              based on a tacit assumption that the set of reads are first
              collected through a sequencing process and then are processed
              through a computation process, i.e., there are two different
              machines: one for sequencing and one for processing. In this
              paper, we present a significant improvement compared to
              Lander-Waterman's result and prove that by combining the
              sequencing and computing processes, one can re-sequence the whole
              genome with as low as O(G) sequenced bases in total. Our approach
              also dramatically reduces the required computational power for
              the combined process. Simulation results are performed on real
              genomes with different sequencing error rates. The results
              support our theory predicting the log G improvement on coverage
              bound and corresponding reduction in the total number of bases
              required to be sequenced.",

               resistance genes and associated mobile elements, as previously
               shown. Such strong selection may be boosted by the use of
               activated sludge (AS) technology, where microbes that are able
               to thrive on the chemicals within the wastewater are
               reintroduced at an earlier stage of the process to further
               enhance degradation of incoming chemicals. The microbial
               community structure within such a treatment plant is, however,
               largely unclear. In this study, Illumina-based 16S rRNA amplicon

               of different stages from an Indian treatment plant operated by
               Patancheru Environment Technology Limited (PETL) in Hyderabad,
               India. The plant receives waste water with high levels of
               fluoroquinolones and applies AS technology. A total of 1,019,400
               sequences from samples of different stages of the treatment
               process were analyzed. In total 202, 303, 732, 652, 947 and 864

               tank, secondary sludge and old sludge samples from PETL,

               the dominant classes. Alcaligenaceae and Pseudomonadaceae,
               bacterial families from PETL previously reported to be highly
               multidrug resistant, were the dominant families in aeration tank
               samples. Despite regular addition of human sewage (approximately
               20\%) to uphold microbial activity, the bacterial diversity
               within aeration tanks from PETL was considerably lower than
               corresponding samples from seven, regular municipal waste water
               treatment plants. The strong selection pressure from antibiotics
               present may be one important factor in structuring the microbial
               community in PETL, which may affect not only resistance

              amplification, via the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), as part

              in sequencing data and contribute to false mutations that can
              ultimately confound genetic analysis. In this report, a

               Recently, a new library preparation method has been introduced
               which has eliminated the need for the ligation step. This
               method, termed SMART (switching mechanism at the 5' end of the

              roles of their constituent organisms' underlying interactions. A
              common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a
              network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from
              a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances
              across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode
              information about ecological interactions and processes,
              resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species.
              However, common methods for identifying these pairwise
              interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns
              that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this
              problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null
              models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise.
              We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to
              the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying
              it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many

              and associated antibiotic resistance in the secondary care
              setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort
              study, with E. coli bacteraemia as the main exposure of interest.
              Adult hospital in-patients, admitted to acute NHS hospitals
              between July 2011 and June 2012 were included. English national
              surveillance and administrative datasets were utilised. Cox
              proportional hazard, subdistribution hazard and multistate models
              were constructed to estimate rate of discharge, rate of
              in-hospital death and excess length of stay, with a unit bed day
              cost applied to the latter to estimate cost burden from the
              healthcare system perspective. RESULTS: 14,042 E. coli
              bacteraemia and 8,919,284 non-infected inpatient observations
              were included. E. coli bacteraemia was associated with an
              increased rate of in-hospital death across all models, with an
              adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of 5.88 (95\% CI:
              5.62-6.15). Resistance was not found to be associated with
              in-hospital mortality once adjusting for patient and hospital
              covariates. However, resistance was found to be associated with
              an increased excess length of stay. This was especially true for
              third generation cephalosporin (1.58 days excess length of stay,
              95\% CI: 0.84-2.31) and piperacillin/tazobactam resistance (1.23
              days (95\% CI: 0.50-1.95)). The annual cost of E. coli
              bacteraemia was estimated to be \pounds{}14,346,400 (2012
              \pounds{}), with third-generation cephalosporin resistance
              associated with excess costs per infection of \pounds{}420 (95\%
              CI: 220-630). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli bacteraemia places a
              statistically significant burden on patient health and the
              hospital sector in England. Resistance to front-line antibiotics
              increases length of stay; increasing the cost burden of such
              infections in the secondary care setting.",

              evolution, often altering the function of the cell that they
              infect via transfer of new genes e.g., virulence or antibiotic
              resistance factors, inactivation of existing genes or by
              modifying gene expression. Recently, phage therapy has gathered
              renewed interest as a promising alternative to control bacterial
              infections. Cataloging the repertoire of prophages in large
              collections of species' genomes is an important initial step in
              understanding their evolution and potential therapeutic utility.
              However, current widely-used tools for identifying prophages
              within bacterial genome sequences are mainly web-based, can have
              long response times, and do not scale to keep pace with the many
              thousands of genomes currently being sequenced routinely.
              METHODOLOGY: In this work, we present ProphET, an easy to install
              prophage predictor to be used in Linux operation system, without
              the constraints associated with a web-based tool. ProphET
              predictions rely on similarity searches against a database of
              prophage genes, taking as input a bacterial genome sequence in
              FASTA format and its corresponding gene annotation in GFF.
              ProphET identifies prophages in three steps: similarity search,
              calculation of the density of prophage genes, and edge
              refinement. ProphET performance was evaluated and compared with
              other phage predictors based on a set of 54 bacterial genomes
              containing 267 manually annotated prophages. FINDINGS AND

              includes two methyltransferases putatively involved in viral mRNA

              (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity was recently

              for reconstructing transmission trees in infectious disease
              outbreaks from densely sampled whole genome sequence data.
              However, a fundamental and as of yet poorly addressed limitation
              of such approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to
              arise on epidemiological timescales. Specifically, the position
              of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be
              resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between
              the sampled pathogen genomes. To quantify and compare the useful
              genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different
              pathogen outbreaks, we introduce here the concept of
              'transmission divergence', defined as the number of mutations
              separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission
              pairs. Using parameter values obtained by literature review, we
              simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using
              two models described in the literature to describe transmission
              divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. We find that
              while mean values vary significantly between the pathogens
              considered, their transmission divergence is generally very low,
              with many outbreaks characterised by large numbers of genetically
              identical transmission pairs. We describe the impact of
              transmission divergence on our ability to reconstruct outbreaks
              using two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages
              outbreaker and phybreak, and demonstrate that, in agreement with
              previous observations, genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving
              pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on
              individual transmission events. Conversely, sequence data of
              pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including
              Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei and Clostridium
              difficile, provide little to no information about individual
              transmission events. Our results highlight the informational
              limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak
              scenarios, and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of

              increased in carriage and disease. Vaccination also disrupts the

              polymorphic protein antigens. We found the impact of PCV on the
              pneumococcal population could be observed in reduced diversity, a
              smaller pangenome, and changing frequencies of accessory clusters
              of orthologous groups (COGs). Post-PCV7, diversity rebounded
              through clonal expansion of NVT lineages and inferred
              in-migration of two previously unobserved lineages. Accessory
              COGs frequencies trended toward pre-PCV7 values with increasing

              characterized by almost ubiquitous significant results, with
              claims about the potential importance, but few of these
              discovered biomarkers are used in routine clinical care. CONTENT:
              The pipeline of biomarker development includes several specific
              stages: discovery, validation, clinical translation, evaluation,
              implementation (and, in the case of nonutility,
              deimplementation). Each of these stages can be plagued by
              problems that cause failures of the overall pipeline. Some
              problems are nonspecific challenges for all biomedical
              investigation, while others are specific to the peculiarities of
              biomarker research. Discovery suffers from poor methods and
              incomplete and selective reporting. External independent
              validation is limited. Selection for clinical translation is
              often shaped by nonrational choices. Evaluation is sparse and the
              clinical utility of many biomarkers remains unknown. The
              regulatory environment for biomarkers remains weak and guidelines
              can reach biased or divergent recommendations. Removing
              inefficient or even harmful biomarkers that have been entrenched
              in clinical care can meet with major resistance. SUMMARY: The
              current biomarker pipeline is too prone to failures.
              Consideration of clinical needs should become a starting point
              for the development of biomarkers. Improvements can include the

              collaborative studies, careful external independent validation,
              preregistration, rigorous systematic reviews and umbrella

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The wide array of pathogens responsible for
              infectious diseases makes it difficult to identify causative
              pathogens with single-plex tests. Although multiplex PCR detects
              multiple targets, it is restricted to centralized laboratories,
              which delays test results or makes multiplexing unavailable,
              depriving healthcare providers of critical, real-time
              information. METHODS: To address the need for point-of-care (POC)
              highly multiplexed tests, we propose the 2-stage, nested-like,
              rapid (<40 min) isothermal amplification assay, dubbed rapid
              amplification (RAMP). RAMP's first-stage uses outer loop-mediated
              isothermal amplification (LAMP) primers to amplify all targets
              with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). First-stage
              amplicons are aliquoted to second stage reactors, each
              specialized for a specific target, to undergo LAMP. The assay is
              implemented in a microfluidic chip. LAMP amplicons are detected
              in situ with colorimetric dye or with a fluorescent dye and a
              smartphone. RESULTS: In experiments on a benchtop and in a
              microfluidic format, RAMP demonstrated high level of multiplexing
              ($\geq$16); high sensitivity (i.e., 1 plaque-forming unit of Zika
              virus) and specificity (no false positives or negatives); speed
              (<40 min); ease of use; and ability to cope with minimally
              processed samples. CONCLUSIONS: RAMP is a hybrid, 2-stage, rapid,
              and highly sensitive and specific assay with extensive
              multiplexing capabilities, combining the advantages of RPA and
              LAMP, while circumventing their respective shortcomings. RAMP can
              be used in the lab, but one of its distinct advantages is
              amenability to simple implementation in a microfluidic format for
              use at the POC, providing healthcare personnel with an
              inexpensive, highly sensitive tool to detect multiple pathogens

  abstract = "Knowing mutation rates and the molecular spectrum of spontaneous
              mutations is important to understanding how the genetic
              composition of viral populations evolves. Previous studies have
              shown that the rate of spontaneous mutations for RNA viruses
              widely varies between 0.01 and 2 mutations per genome and
              generation, with plant RNA viruses always occupying the lower
              side of this range. However, this peculiarity of plant RNA
              viruses is based on a very limited number of studies. Here we
              analyze the spontaneous mutational spectrum and the mutation rate
              of Tobacco etch potyvirus, a model system of positive sense RNA
              viruses. Our experimental setup minimizes the action of purifying
              selection on the mutational spectrum, thus giving a picture of
              what types of mutations are produced by the viral replicase. As
              expected for a neutral target, we found that transitions and
              nonsynonymous (including a few stop codons and small deletions)
              mutations were the most abundant type. This spectrum was notably
              different from the one previously described for another plant
              virus. We have estimated that the spontaneous mutation rate for
              this virus was in the range 10(-6)-10(-5) mutations per site and
              generation. Our estimates are in the same biological ballpark
              that previous values reported for plant RNA viruses. This finding

  abstract = "Population genomic analyses have demonstrated power to address
              major questions in evolutionary and molecular microbiology.
              Collecting populations of genomes is hindered in many microbial
              species by the absence of a cost effective and practical method
              to collect ample quantities of sufficiently pure genomic DNA for
              next-generation sequencing. Here we present a simple method to
              amplify genomes of a target microbial species present in a
              complex, natural sample. The selective whole genome amplification
              (SWGA) technique amplifies target genomes using nucleotide
              sequence motifs that are common in the target microbe genome, but
              rare in the background genomes, to prime the highly processive
              phi29 polymerase. SWGA thus selectively amplifies the target
              genome from samples in which it originally represented a minor
              fraction of the total DNA. The post-SWGA samples are enriched in
              target genomic DNA, which are ideal for population resequencing.
              We demonstrate the efficacy of SWGA using both
              laboratory-prepared mixtures of cultured microbes as well as a
              natural host-microbe association. Targeted amplification of
              Borrelia burgdorferi mixed with Escherichia coli at genome ratios
              of 1:2000 resulted in >10(5)-fold amplification of the target
              genomes with <6.7-fold amplification of the background.
              SWGA-treated genomic extracts from Wolbachia pipientis-infected
              Drosophila melanogaster resulted in up to 70\% of high-throughput
              resequencing reads mapping to the W. pipientis genome. By
              contrast, 2-9\% of sequencing reads were derived from W.
              pipientis without prior amplification. The SWGA technique results
              in high sequencing coverage at a fraction of the sequencing
              effort, thus allowing population genomic studies at affordable
              costs.",

               wide range of concepts and criteria, and there is no consistent
               association between the term used and the concepts and criteria
               intended. A classification of concepts is made, i.e. a

               Beta (environmental conditions) and Alpha (resource use) guild
               concepts. Species that are in the same Beta (environmental
               conditions) guild, prefer the same conditions and will tend to
               be found together. Species that are in the same Alpha (resource
               use) guild will not necessarily occur together; in fact, if the
               resource is limiting, competitive exclusion would tend to lead
               to their not being found together. The classification takes into

              sputum samples is commonly used to diagnose Middle East
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Owing to
              the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus,
              sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid
              isolation. We determined optimal homogenization methods for
              isolating viral nucleic acids from sputum. METHODS: We evaluated
              the following three sputum-homogenization methods: proteinase K
              and DNase I (PK-DNase) treatment, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
              treatment, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium citrate (NALC)
              treatment. Sputum samples were spiked with inactivated MERS-CoV
              culture isolates. RNA was extracted from pretreated, spiked
              samples using the easyMAG system (bioM{\'e}rieux, France).
              Extracted RNAs were then subjected to rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV
              diagnosis (DiaPlex Q MERS-coronavirus, SolGent, Korea). RESULTS:
              While analyzing 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in technical
              duplicate, false-negative results were obtained with five
              (16.7\%) and four samples (13.3\%), respectively, by using the
              PBS and NALC methods. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values
              observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1-35.4 with
              the PK-DNase method, 34.7-39.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9-38.6
              with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were
              prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral
              culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the
              PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control
              Ct of 33.2 (both P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The PK-DNase method is

              lacking about the molecular interaction of these bacterial
              communities with the host genome and the possible outcomes in
              host biology. A range of OMICs approaches have provided great
              progress linking the microbiota to health and disease. However,
              the investigation of this context through proteomic mass
              spectrometry-based tools is still being improved. Therefore,
              metaproteomics or community proteogenomics has emerged as a
              complementary approach to metagenomic data, as a field in
              proteomics aiming to perform large-scale characterization of
              proteins from environmental microbiota, such as the human gut.
              The advances in molecular separation methods coupled with mass
              spectrometry (e.g., LC-MS/MS) and proteome bioinformatics have
              been fundamental in these novel large-scale metaproteomic
              studies, which have further been performed in a wide range of

              Sequence reads from these regions are therefore unmappable when

              tested it on a dataset with 335 bacterial and 177 phage genomes.
              We show that three simple genomic features extracted from contig

              mainly produced by the participation of genetic mobilization

              incorporation in hierarchical structures associated with
              multifaceted genetic structures including complex class 1

  author   = "Schimel, Joshua P and Schaeffer, Sean M",
  abstract = "A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on
              understanding when and how the composition of the microbial
              community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at
              the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years).
              While research has demonstrated these linkages for
              physiologically and phylogenetically ``narrow'' processes such as
              trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive
              evidence that microbial community composition influences the
              ``broad'' processes of decomposition and organic matter (OM)
              turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial
              community structure influences C cycling. We consider the
              phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds,
              based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these
              are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of
              the species-level diversity probably reflects functional
              redundancy. We then consider under what conditions it is possible
              for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and
              argue that while microbial community structure may be important
              in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus,
              it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil,
              physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the
              rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM
              turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the
              C they take up - not only do the fates of the molecules differ,
              but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For
              example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides
              can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes
              allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding
              the long-term fate of C in soil - is it sequestered or not?",

  abstract = "The use of antibiotic agents as growth promoters was banned in

              heavy metals used in animal farming and aquaculture might promote
              the spread of antibiotic resistance via co-selection. To
              investigate which heavy metals are likely to co-select for
              antibiotic resistance in soil and water, the available data on
              heavy metal pollution, heavy metal toxicity, heavy metal
              tolerance, and co-selection mechanisms was reviewed.
              Additionally, the risk of metal driven co-selection of antibiotic
              resistance in the environment was assessed based on heavy metal
              concentrations that potentially induce this co-selection process.
              Analyses of the data indicate that agricultural and aquacultural
              practices represent major sources of soil and water contamination
              with moderately to highly toxic metals such as mercury (Hg),
              cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). If those metals reach

              co-selection mechanisms for these heavy metals and clinically as
              well as veterinary relevant antibiotics have been described.
              Therefore, studies investigating co-selection in environments

              reintroduction of polymyxins for antimicrobial therapy has been
              followed by an increase in reports of resistance among
              Gram-negative bacteria. Some bacteria, such as Klebsiella
              pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii,
              develop resistance to polymyxins in a process referred to as
              acquired resistance, whereas other bacteria, such as Proteus
              spp., Serratia spp., and Burkholderia spp., are naturally
              resistant to these drugs. Reports of polymyxin resistance in
              clinical isolates have recently increased, including acquired and

              Compared to barcoding with long fusion primers, our

              free-living bacterial DNA collected from seven sites along rivers
              in three watersheds with varying land use in Southwestern Canada.
              This is the first study to examine the bacterial metagenome in
              flowing freshwater (lotic) environments over such a time span,
              providing an opportunity to describe bacterial community
              variability as a function of land use and environmental
              conditions. Characteristics of the metagenomic data, such as
              sequence composition and average genome size (AGS), vary with
              sampling site, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. For
              example, AGS was correlated with hours of daylight in the
              agricultural watershed and, across the agriculturally and
              urban-affected sites, k-mer composition clustering corresponded
              to nutrient concentrations. In addition to indicating a community
              shift, this change in AGS has implications in terms of the
              normalization strategies required, and considerations surrounding

              abundances of gene functional groups between high- and

              role in microbe selection and in the construction of a metabolic
              signaling network. The microbial activities are affected by

              can offer deep insights on the impact of lifestyle and dietary
              factors on chronic and acute diseases. Metagenomics,
              metaproteomics and metabolomics are some of the meta-omics
              approaches to study the modulation of the gut microbiota.
              Metabolomic research applied to biofluids allows to: define the
              metabolic profile; identify and quantify classes and compounds of
              interest; characterize small molecules produced by intestinal
              microbes; and define the biochemical pathways of metabolites.

              the principal technologies applied to metabolomics in terms of
              coverage, sensitivity and quantification. Moreover, the use of

              India. Although a reserve agent, with rise in rates of resistance
              to carbapenems, the usage of colistin has increased over the
              years leading to slow emergence of resistance. Colistin
              resistance is mainly mediated by the alteration in the LPS of
              bacterial outer membrane with the addition of L-Ara4-N and PEtN
              molecules. These alterations are mediated by mutations in several

              to 1024 $\mu$g/ml and 0.5 to 2048 $\mu$g/ml respectively.
              Multiple mutations were observed in the chromosomal genes

              is more than 2-fold higher than that of other Gramella species.
              The functional profiles of the GHs suggest extensive variation in
              Gramella species. Growth experiments revealed that G. flava
              JLT2011 has the ability to utilize a wide range of
              polysaccharides for growth such as xylan and homogalacturonan in

              multi-gene polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) or PUL-like
              systems in G. flava JLT2011. This species was also found to
              harbor the two xylan PULs and a pectin PUL, respectively. Gene

  abstract = "Viral protein synthesis is completely dependent upon the host
              cell's translational machinery. Canonical translation of host
              mRNAs depends on structural elements such as the 5' cap structure
              and/or the 3' poly(A) tail of the mRNAs. Although many viral
              mRNAs are devoid of one or both of these structures, they can
              still translate efficiently using non-canonical mechanisms. Here,
              we review the tools utilized by positive-sense single-stranded
              (+ss) RNA plant viruses to initiate non-canonical translation,
              focusing oncis-acting sequences present in viral mRNAs. We
              highlight how these elements may interact with host translation
              factors and speculate on their contribution for achieving
              translational control. We also describe other translation
              strategies used by plant viruses to optimize the usage of the
              coding capacity of their very compact genomes, including leaky
              scanning initiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon
              readthrough. Finally, future research perspectives on the unusual
              translational strategies of +ssRNA viruses are discussed,
              including parallelisms between viral and host mRNAs mechanisms of
              translation, particularly for host mRNAs which are translated

              understand ABR reservoirs in the environment and their potential
              impact on health. METHOD/DESIGN: Quantitative and qualitative
              data will be collected during a 3-year follow-up study of a river
              associated with religious mass-bathing in Central India.
              Surface-water and sediment samples will be collected from seven
              locations at regular intervals for 3 years during religious
              mass-bathing and in absence of it to monitor water-quality,
              antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance
              genes and metals. Approval has been obtained from the Ethics
              Committee of R.D. Gardi Medical College, Ujjain, India (No.
              2013/07/17-311). RESULTS: The results will address the issue of
              antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance with a focus on a
              river environment in India within a typical socio-behavioural
              context of religious mass-bathing. It will enhance our

              decades as an important opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, in
              part due to its high capacity of acquiring resistance to diverse
              antibiotic families, including to the so-called last line drugs
              such as carbapenems. The rampant selective pressure and genetic
              exchange of resistance genes hinder the effective treatment of
              resistant infections. A. baumannii uses all the resistance
              mechanisms to survive against carbapenems but production of
              carbapenemases are the major mechanism, which may act in synergy
              with others. A. baumannii appears to use all the mechanisms of

               add phages effective against emerging pathogenic strains. In

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: PREMISE OF THE STUDY: To study gene expression in
              plants, high-quality RNA must be extracted in quantities
              sufficient for subsequent cDNA library construction. Field-based
              collections are often limited in quantity and quality of tissue
              and are typically preserved in RNAlater. Obtaining sufficient and
              high-quality yield from variously preserved samples is essential
              to studies of comparative biology. We present a protocol for the
              extraction of high-quality RNA from even the most recalcitrant
              plant tissues. • METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissues from mosses,
              cycads, and angiosperm floral organs and leaves were preserved in
              RNAlater or frozen fresh at -80°C. Extractions were performed and
              quality was measured for yield and purity. • CONCLUSIONS: This
              protocol results in the extraction of high-quality RNA from a
              variety of plant tissues representing vascular and nonvascular
              plants. RNA was used for cDNA synthesis to generate libraries for
              next-generation sequencing and for expression studies using

              tested across > 1 500 species (1 931 strains or specimens) and
              the outcomes of almost twenty thousand (19 577) polymerase chain
              reactions were evaluated. We tested several well-known primer
              pairs that amplify: i) sections of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene
              large subunit (D1-D2 domains of 26/28S); ii) the complete
              internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1/2); iii) partial $\beta$

              largest subunit of RNA-polymerase II (partial RPB2, section 5-6).
              Their PCR efficiencies were compared with novel candidate primers
              corresponding to: i) the fungal-specific translation elongation
              factor 3 (TEF3); ii) a small ribosomal protein necessary for
              t-RNA docking; iii) the 60S L10 (L1) RP; iv) DNA topoisomerase I

              protein LNS2; and vii) alternative sections of TEF1$\alpha$.
              Results showed that several gene sections are accessible to
              universal primers (or primers universal for phyla) yielding a
              single PCR-product. Barcode gap and multi-dimensional scaling

              as high cost, complicated procedures, tremendous data analysis,
              and high background noise in clinical samples. METHODS: Viruses
              from cell culture materials or clinical specimens were identified
              following an improved NGS procedure: reduction of background
              noise by sample preprocessing, viral enrichment by barcoded
              oligonucleotide (random hexamer or non-ribosomal hexanucleotide)
              primer-based amplification, fragmentation-free library
              construction and sequencing of one-tube mixtures, as well as
              rapid data analysis using an in-house pipeline. RESULTS: NGS data
              demonstrated that both barcoded primer sets were useful to
              simultaneously capture multiple viral pathogens in cell culture
              materials or clinical specimens and verified that hexanucleotide
              primers captured as many viral sequences as hexamers did.
              Moreover, direct testing of clinical specimens using this
              improved hexanucleotide primer-based NGS approach provided
              further detailed genotypes of enteroviruses causing hand, foot,

  abstract = "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are small genetic elements composed
              of a toxin gene and its cognate antitoxin. The toxins of all
              known TA systems are proteins while the antitoxins are either
              proteins or non-coding RNAs. Based on the molecular nature of the
              antitoxin and its mode of interaction with the toxin the TA
              modules are currently grouped into five classes. In general, the
              toxin is more stable than the antitoxin but the latter is
              expressed to a higher level. If supply of the antitoxin stops,
              for instance under special growth conditions or by plasmid loss
              in case of plasmid encoded TA systems, the antitoxin is rapidly
              degraded and can no longer counteract the toxin. Consequently,
              the toxin becomes activated and can act on its cellular targets.
              Typically, TA toxins act on crucial cellular processes including
              translation, replication, cytoskeleton formation, membrane
              integrity, and cell wall biosynthesis. TA systems and their
              components are also versatile tools for a multitude of purposes

  abstract = "The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
              repeats, CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system
              in bacteria and archaea that functions via a distinct
              self-non-self recognition mechanism that is partially analogous
              to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). The
              CRISPR-Cas system incorporates fragments of virus or plasmid DNA
              into the CRISPR repeat cassettes and employs the processed
              transcripts of these spacers as guide RNAs to cleave the cognate
              foreign DNA or RNA. The Cas proteins, however, are not homologous
              to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly
              diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain
              diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread
              RNA-binding domain. Despite the fast evolution that is typical of
              the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RRM in
              most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the
              evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In
              addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the
              immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that
              are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that typically possess
              nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with
              CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins
              of COG1517 that, in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a
              helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain different nuclease
              domains and several other predicted nucleases. The tight
              association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted
              toxins that, upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death
              suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are
              functionally coupled. Such coupling could manifest in the
              persistence state being induced and potentially providing
              conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in

  abstract  = "Background The bacterial 16S rRNA gene has historically been
               used in defining bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny. However,
               there are currently no high-throughput methods to sequence
               full-length 16S rRNA genes present in a sample with precision.
               Results We describe a method for sequencing near full-length 16S
               rRNA gene amplicons using the high throughput Illumina MiSeq
               platform and test it using DNA from human skin swab samples.
               Proof of principle of the approach is demonstrated, with the
               generation of 1,604 sequences greater than 1,300 nt from a
               single Nano MiSeq run, with accuracy estimated to be 100-fold
               higher than standard Illumina reads. The reads were chimera
               filtered using information from a single molecule dual tagging
               scheme that boosts the signal available for chimera detection.
               Conclusions This method could be scaled up to generate many

               conducted to investigate the possibility of identifying isolates
               from unassembled next-generation sequencing reads using
               custom-made guide trees. Results A tool named StrainSeeker was
               developed that constructs a list of specific k-mers for each
               node of any given Newick-format tree and enables the
               identification of bacterial isolates in 1--2 min. It uses a
               novel algorithm, which analyses the observed and expected
               fractions of node-specific k-mers to test the presence of each
               node in the sample. This allows StrainSeeker to determine where
               the isolate branches off the guide tree and assign it to a clade
               whereas other tools assign each read to a reference genome.
               Using a dataset of 100 Escherichia coli isolates, we demonstrate
               that StrainSeeker can predict the clades of E. coli with 92\%
               accuracy and correct tree branch assignment with 98\% accuracy.
               Twenty-five thousand Illumina HiSeq reads are sufficient for

              are not sensitive enough and require either a known or culturable
              contaminant. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a promising
              approach for detecting contaminants due to its sensitivity and
              lack of need for a priori assumptions about the contaminant.
              Prior to applying WGS, we must first understand its limitations
              for detecting contaminants and potential for false positives.
              Herein we demonstrate and characterize a WGS-based approach to
              detect organismal contaminants using an existing metagenomic
              taxonomic classification algorithm. Simulated WGS datasets from
              ten genera as individuals and binary mixtures of eight organisms
              at varying ratios were analyzed to evaluate the role of
              contaminant concentration and taxonomy on detection. For the
              individual genomes the false positive contaminants reported
              depended on the genus, with Staphylococcus, Escherichia, and
              Shigella having the highest proportion of false positives. For
              nearly all binary mixtures the contaminant was detected in the

              confirmed a secondary transmission network arising from

              of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual
              genes across environments through read recruitment analyses.
              Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique

              reproducible framework to generate pangenomes and to study them
              in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we
              applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the
              context of a large-scale marine metagenomic survey. The resulting
              Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential
              abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that
              belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by
              only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the
              relationships between these genomes based on gene clusters
              correlated with their environmental distribution patterns,
              phylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated
              single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The
              metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly
              occurred in hypervariable genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus

              Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar

              colonizer of humans and a major antibiotic-resistant pathogen
              responsible for a wide spectrum of hospital and
              community-associated infections. Written in Python, Staphopia's
              analysis pipeline consists of submodules running open-source
              tools. It accepts raw FASTQ reads as an input, which undergo
              quality control filtration, error correction and reduction to a
              maximum of approximately 100$\times$ chromosome coverage. This
              reduction significantly reduces total runtime without
              detrimentally affecting the results. The pipeline performs de
              novo assembly-based and mapping-based analysis. Automated gene

               genomes have been constructed directly from complex community
               metagenomes, often through tedious manual curation. To address
               this, we developed the software tool virMine to identify viral
               genomes from raw reads representative of viral or mixed (viral
               and bacterial) communities. virMine automates sequence read

               easily refine their search for a specific study system and/or
               feature(s) of interest. In contrast to other viral genome

               key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans,
               humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this
               recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and
               impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference
               genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral
               diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial
               genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and
               applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated
               in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are
               emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as
               Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms
               or genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing.
               Here, we present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral
               signal in these different types of microbial sequence data in
               both a reference-dependent and reference-independent manner,
               leveraging probabilistic models and extensive virome data to
               maximize detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows
               that VirSorter's prophage prediction capability compares to that
               of available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is
               superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome
               (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or
               partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter
               outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and
               metagenomic datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled
               sequence (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect
               identification (>95\% Recall and 100\% Precision) on contigs of
               at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it
               can also be used in ``reverse'' to more confidently identify
               viral sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA
               whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized
               transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made
               available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a
               web-based user interface interconnected with the required
               computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing
               prophage prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG
               and metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern
               sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the
               discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our
               understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse

              activity have been studied by extending the CS 5' upstream and 3'
              downstream. Sequences from virus genes flanking the CS influenced
              transcription levels from moderate (10- to 20-fold variation) to

              cellular proteins. By analogy to other plus-stranded RNA viruses,
              such as polioviruses, in which translation and replication switch
              involves a cellular factor (PCBP) and a viral protein (3CD) it is
              conceivable that in CoVs the switch between replication and

              that are specifically recruited by the replication or
              transcription complexes. Complexes between RNA motifs such as
              TRS-L and the TRS-Bs located along the CoV genome are probably

              domains that consist of at least one binding domain and one
              catalytic domain. ChiA (ca. 39 kDa) contains a putative signal
              peptide, as well as a binding domain (ChiA(BD)), that is related
              to binding domains associated with several previously studied
              bacterial chitinases. chiB, separated by 37 nucleotides from chiA
              and in the same orientation, encodes a polypeptide with two
              different proline-threonine-rich linker regions (6 and 3 kDa)
              flanking a chitin-binding domain (ChiB(BD) [11 kDa]), followed by
              a catalytic domain (ChiB(cat) [35 kDa]). No apparent signal
              peptide is encoded within chiB. The two chitinases share little
              sequence homology to each other, except in the catalytic region,
              where both have the catalytic glutamic acid residue that is
              conserved in all family 18 bacterial chitinases. The genes
              encoding ChiA, without its signal peptide, and ChiB were cloned
              and expressed in Escherichia coli. ChiA exhibited no detectable
              activity toward chitooligomers smaller than chitotetraose,
              indicating that the enzyme is an endochitinase. Kinetic studies
              showed that ChiB followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward
              chitotriose, although substrate inhibition was observed for
              larger chitooligomers. Hydrolysis patterns on
              chitooligosaccharides indicated that ChiB is a chitobiosidase,
              processively cleaving off chitobiose from the nonreducing end of
              chitin or other chitooligomers. Synergistic activity was noted
              for the two chitinases on colloidal chitin, indicating that these
              two enzymes work together to recruit chitin-based substrates for
              P. furiosus growth. This was supported by the observed growth on
              chitin as the sole carbohydrate source in sulfur-free media.",

              enveloped plus-strand RNA virus with a genome of approximately 13
              kb. Based on similarities in genome organization and protein
              expression, the arteriviruses have recently been grouped together
              with the coronaviruses and toroviruses in the newly established
              order Nidovirales. Previously, we reported the construction of
              pEDI, a full-length cDNA copy of EAV DI-b, a natural defective
              interfering (DI) RNA of 5.6 kb (R. Molenkamp et al., J. Virol.
              74:3156-3165, 2000). EDI RNA consists of three noncontiguous
              parts of the EAV genome fused in frame with respect to the
              replicase gene. As a result, EDI RNA contains a truncated
              replicase open reading frame (EDI-ORF) and encodes a truncated
              replicase polyprotein. Since some coronavirus DI RNAs require the
              presence of an ORF for their efficient propagation, we have
              analyzed the importance of the EDI-ORF in EDI RNA replication.
              The EDI-ORF was disrupted at different positions by the
              introduction of frameshift mutations. These were found either to
              block DI RNA replication completely or to be removed within one
              virus passage, probably due to homologous recombination with the
              helper virus genome. Using recombination assays based on EDI RNA
              and full-length EAV genomes containing specific mutations, the
              rates of homologous RNA recombination in the 3'- and 5'-proximal
              regions of the EAV genome were studied. Remarkably, the
              recombination frequency in the 5'-proximal region was found to be

              properties of RNA viruses that are relevant for studying
              evolution. On the other hand, population genetics is a
              reductionistic theory of evolution. It does not consider or make
              simplistic assumptions on the transformation laws within and
              between genotypic and phenotypic spaces. However, such laws are
              minimized in the case of RNA viruses because the phenotypic space
              maps onto the genotypic space in a much more linear way than on
              higher DNA-based organisms. Under experimental conditions, we

              The structure of a TGEV defective interfering RNA of 9.7 kb
              (DI-C) was described previously (A. Mendez, C. Smerdou, A. Izeta,

              cells and inhibited 20-fold the replication of the parental
              genome. A collection of 14 DI-C RNA deletion mutants (TGEV
              minigenomes) was synthetically generated and tested for their
              ability to be replicated and packaged. The smallest minigenome
              (M33) that was replicated by the helper virus and efficiently
              packaged was 3.3 kb. A minigenome of 2.1 kb (M21) was also
              replicated, but it was packaged with much lower efficiency than
              the M33 minigenome, suggesting that it had lost either the
              sequences containing the main packaging signal or the required
              secondary structure in the packaging signal due to alteration of
              the flanking sequences. The low packaging efficiency of the M21
              minigenome was not due to minimum size restrictions. The
              sequences essential for minigenome replication by the helper
              virus were reduced to 1,348 nt and 492 nt at the 5' and 3' ends,
              respectively. The TGEV-derived RNA minigenomes were successfully
              expressed following a two-step amplification system that couples
              pol II-driven transcription in the nucleus to replication
              supported by helper virus in the cytoplasm, without any obvious
              splicing. This system and the use of the reporter gene
              beta-glucuronidase (GUS) allowed minigenome detection at passage
              zero, making it possible to distinguish replication efficiency
              from packaging capability. The synthetic minigenomes have been
              used to design a helper-dependent expression system that produces

              of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they
              index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories.
              To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing
              (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic
              portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization
              of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences
              of approximately 470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a
              reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from
              invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles
              were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed
              from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by
              cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were
              consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by
              multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments
              was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved
              by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages
              of serogroups A, B, and C meningococci were identical for all
              loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus.
              MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major
              meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can
              be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid
              organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The
              overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing
              methods is that sequence data are truly portable between
              laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per
              species to be placed on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling

              employs a DNA polymerase and a set of four specially designed

              target DNA. An inner primer containing sequences of the sense and

              synthesis primed by the second inner and outer primers that

              nucleotides was changed individually to the three alternative
              bases. These mutants were used to define how changes in the
              integrity of MHV transcription consensus sequence UCUAAAC
              affected mRNA transcription. Except for two mutants with the
              sequences UGUAAAC and UCGAAAC, all of the mutants supported
              efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription. This indicated that
              MHV transcription regulation was sufficiently flexible to
              recognize altered consensus sequences. Next, these and other
              mutants were used to examine the leader-body fusion site on the
              subgenomic DI RNAs. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all
              subgenomic DI RNAs analyzed contained two pentanucleotide
              sequences; the first sequence seemed to be contributed by the
              leader, and the leader-body fusion most likely took place at
              either the first or the second nucleotide of the second sequence.
              This observation was not consistent with the proposed coronavirus
              transcription model (S. C. Baker and M. M. C. Lai, EMBO J.

  author   = "Armstrong, Joe",
  abstract = "The work described in this thesis is the result of a research
              program started in 1981 to find better ways of programming
              Telecom applications. These applications are large programs which
              despite careful testing will probably contain many errors when
              the program is put into service. We assume that such programs do
              contain errors, and investigate methods for building reliable
              systems despite such errors. The research has resulted in the
              development of a new programming language (called Erlang),
              together with a design methodology, and set of libraries for
              building robust systems (called OTP). At the time of writing the
              technology described here is used in a number of major Ericsson,
              and Nortel products. A number of small companies have also been
              formed which exploit the technology. The central problem
              addressed by this thesis is the problem of constructing reliable
              systems from programs which may themselves contain errors.
              Constructing such systems imposes a number of requirements on any
              programming language that is to be used for the construction. I
              discuss these language requirements, and show how they are
              satisfied by Erlang. Problems can be solved in a programming
              language, or in the standard libraries which accompany the
              language. I argue how certain of the requirements necessary to
              build a fault-tolerant system are solved in the language, and
              others are solved in the standard libraries. Together these form
              a basis for building fault-tolerant software systems. No theory
              is complete without proof that the ideas work in practice. To
              demonstrate that these ideas work in practice I present a number
              of case studies of large commercially successful products which
              use this technology. At the time of writing the largest of these
              projects is a major Ericsson product, having over a million lines
              of Erlang code. This product (the AXD301) is thought to be one of
              the most reliable products ever made by Ericsson. Finally, I ask
              if the goal of finding better ways to program Telecom
              applications was fulfilled --- I also point to areas where I
              think the system could be improved.",

              thermostable DNA polymerase. The purity and yield of the reaction
              products depend on several parameters, one of which is the
              annealing temperature (Ta). At both sub- and super-optimal Ta
              values, non-specific products may be formed, and the yield of

              when long products are synthesized or when total genomic DNA is
              the substrate for PCR. In this article we experimentally

              agree to within 0.7 degree C eliminates the need for determining
              TaOPT experimentally. Synthesis of DNA fragments shorter than 1

              order to better define the genetic variation that accompanies
              their physiological diversity, sequences for the 16S-23S rDNA
              internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were determined in 32

              of the sequences for phylogenetic analyses. The previously
              observed division of Prochlorococcus into two ecotypes (called
              high and low-B/A after their differences in chlorophyll content)
              were supported, as was the subdivision of the high-B/A ecotype

              partitioned marine cluster A Synechococcus into six clades, three
              of which can be associated with a particular phenotype (motility,
              chromatic adaptation, and lack of phycourobilin). The pattern of
              sequence divergence within and between clades is suggestive of a

  abstract = "Results of earlier work had suggested that utilization of
              polysaccharides by Bacteroides spp. did not proceed via breakdown
              by extracellular polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. Rather, it
              appeared that the polysaccharide was first bound to a putative
              outer membrane receptor complex and then translocated into the
              periplasm, where the degradative enzymes were located. In a
              recent article, we reported the cloning and sequencing of susC, a
              gene from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that encoded a 115-kDa
              outer membrane protein. SusC protein proved to be essential for
              utilization not only of starch but also of intermediate-sized
              maltooligosaccharides (maltose to maltoheptaose). In this paper,
              we report the sequencing of a 7-kbp region of the B.
              thetaiotaomicron chromosome that lies immediately downstream of
              susC. We found four genes in this region (susD, susE, susF, and
              susG). Transcription of these genes was maltose inducible, and
              the genes appeared to be part of the same operon as susC. Western
              blot (immunoblot) analysis using antisera raised against proteins
              encoded by each of the four genes showed that all four were outer
              membrane proteins. Protein database searches revealed that SusE
              had limited similarity to a glucanohydrolase from Clostridium
              acetobutylicum and SusG had high similarity to amylases from a
              variety of sources. SusD and SusF had no significant similarity
              to any proteins in the databases. Results of 14C-starch binding
              assays suggested that SusD makes a major contribution to binding.
              SusE and SusF also appear to contribute to binding but not to the
              same extent as SusD. SusG is essential for growth on starch but
              appears to contribute little to starch binding. Our results
              demonstrate that the binding of starch to the B. thetaiotaomicron
              surface involves at least four outer membrane proteins (SusC,
              SusD, SusE, and SusF), which may form a surface receptor complex.
              The role of SusG in binding is still unclear.",

               viral evolution is especially topical given the growing
               awareness that emerging and re-emerging diseases (most of which
               are caused by RNA viruses) represent a major threat to public
               health. However, while the study of viral evolution has
               developed rapidly in the last 30 years, relatively little
               attention has been directed toward linking work on the
               mechanisms of viral evolution within cells or individual hosts,

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA) is a
              sequence-independent virus discovery method that was recently
              developed and successfully used to characterize unknown viruses
              in cell cultures. Its applicability, however, is limited by its
              low sensitivity. METHODOLOGY: We evaluated whether the
              introduction of prior amplification of target sequences by random
              PCR (rPCR) increases the sensitivity of this method to improve
              its use on clinical specimens. In addition, ultracentrifugation
              was added to the protocol to allow for pooling of multiple
              samples, thereby increasing analytical throughput of the VIDSCA.
              RESULTS: We showed that rPCR enhanced the sensitivity of VIDISCA
              by 100-fold for two out of four viruses in different clinical
              samples, and that the ultracentrifugation step allowed for
              analyzing samples of large volumes (4 ml) and simultaneous

              Electroporation of in vitro T7-transcribed CD-91 RNA into IBV

              CD-58, and CD-61--in which 4,639, 3,236, and 2,953 nucleotides,
              respectively, were removed from CD-91, resulting in the
              truncation of the CD-91 long open reading frame (ORF) from 6,465
              to 1,311, 1,263, or 2,997 nucleotides in CD-44, CD-58, or CD-61,

              the three constructs into IBV helper virus-infected cells
              resulted in the replication and packaging of CD-58 and CD-61 but
              not CD-44 RNA. The ORF of CD-61 was further truncated by the
              insertion of stop codons into the CD-61 sequence by PCR
              mutagenesis, resulting in constructs CD-61T11 (ORF: nucleotides
              996 to 1,058, encoding 20 amino acids), CD-61T22 (ORF:

  abstract = "We have developed a novel multiplex quantitative DNA array based
              PCR method (MQDA-PCR). The MQDA-PCR is general and may be used in
              all areas of biological science where simultaneous quantification
              of multiple gene targets is desired. We used quantification of
              transgenic maize in food and feed as a model system to show the
              applicability of the method. The method is based on a two-step
              PCR. In the first few cycles bipartite primers containing a
              universal 5' 'HEAD' region and a 3' region specific to each
              genetically modified (GM) construct are employed. The unused
              primers are then degraded with a single-strand DNA-specific
              exonuclease. The second step of the PCR is run containing only
              primers consisting of the universal HEAD region. The removal of
              the primers is essential to create a competitive, and thus
              quantitative PCR. Oligo nucleotides hybridising to internal
              segments of the PCR products are then sequence specifically
              labelled in a cyclic linear signal amplification reaction. This
              is done both to increase the sensitivity and the specificity of
              the assay. Hybridisation of the labelled oligonucleotides to
              their complementary sequences in a DNA array enables multiplex
              detection. Quantitative information was obtained in the range
              0.1-2\% for the different GM constructs tested. Seventeen
              different food and feed samples were screened using a twelve-plex
              system for simultaneous detection of seven different GM maize
              events (Bt176, Bt11, Mon810, T25, GA21, CBH351 and DBT418). Ten
              samples were GM positive containing mainly mixtures of Mon810,
              Bt11 and Bt176 DNA. One sample contained appreciable amounts of
              GA21. An eight-plex MQDA-PCR system for detection of Mon810, Bt11
              and Bt176 was evaluated by comparison with simplex 5' nuclease
              PCRs. There were no significant differences in the
              quantifications using the two approaches. The samples could, by
              both methods, be quantified as containing >2\%, between 1 and
              2\%, between 0.1 and 1\%, or <0.1\% in 43 out of 47

              The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing
              methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous
              regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform
              (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence
              composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid
              residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that
              performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy
              of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or
              extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar
              length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method
              (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are
              implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i
              were compared with other methods by computer simulations and
              benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced
              as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is
              over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Methods for the extraction of DNA from filamentous
              fungi are frequently laborious and time consuming because most of
              the available protocols include maceration in liquid nitrogen
              after the mycelium has been grown in a liquid culture. This paper
              describes a new method to replace those steps, which involves the
              growth of the mycelium on cellophane disks overlaid on solid
              medium and the use of glass beads for cell wall disruption.
              RESULTS: Extractions carried out by this method provided
              approximately 2 microg of total DNA per cellophane disk for the
              filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. To assess the DNA's
              quality, we made a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification
              of a gene introduced by a transformation in this fungus's genome
              (hph gene), with successful results. We also confirmed the
              quality of the DNA by the use of Southern blotting to analyze the
              presence of the same gene, which was easily detected, resulting
              in a sharply defined and strong band. CONCLUSIONS: The use of
              this method enabled us to obtain pure DNA from Trichoderma
              reesei, dispensing with the laborious and time-consuming steps
              involved in most protocols. The DNA obtained was found to be
              suitable for PCR and Southern blot analyses. Another advantage of
              this method is the fact that several samples can be processed
              simultaneously, growing the fungus on multiple well cell culture
              plates. In addition, the absence of maceration also reduces
              sample handling, minimizing the risks of contamination, a

              N-nonsubstituted sites were determined by dinitrophenylation

              at the O groups takes place as cells go into the stationary
              growth phase, concomitant with a decrease in their lysozyme
              sensitivity. N-nonsubstituted residues, mainly glucosamine,
              occurred in both exponential-phase and stationary-phase walls but
              not in the corresponding peptidoglycans. Small amounts of
              N-nonsubstituted muramic acid were detected in walls and
              peptidoglycan from cells in the stationary growth phase only. N
              acetylation of isolated walls did not increase their lysozyme
              sensitivity but rather decreased it. Autolysis of walls was
              completely inhibited by the chemical modifications used. Trypsin
              stimulates the lysozyme sensitivity of native walls but has no
              effect on walls that had been O deacetylated and N acetylated. It
              is suggested that the effect of trypsin is due to its action as

               many extremely large datasets from which information can be
               gleaned by data mining. This book focuses on practical
               algorithms that have been used to solve key problems in data

              organisms fall into more less discrete clusters on the basis of
              their phenotypic, ecological, and DNA sequence characteristics.
              Each sequence cluster in the bacterial world appears to
              correspond to an ``ecotype,'' defined as a population of cells in
              the same ecological niche, which would all be out-competed by any
              adaptive mutant coming from the population. Ecotypes, so defined,
              share many of the dynamic properties attributed to eukaryotic
              species: genetic diversity within an ecotype is limited by a
              force of cohesion (in this case, periodic selection); different
              ecotypes are free to diverge without constraint from one another;
              and ecotypes are ecologically distinct. Also, ecotypes can be
              discovered and classified as DNA sequence clusters, even when we

              in which the leader is linked to the mRNA coding sequences. This

              analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved,
              requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and
              divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have
              been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method
              that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to
              minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The
              method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that
              fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number
              of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high
              conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment
              more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the
              efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial
              proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes
              belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The
              percentages of removed positions were higher in the most
              divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the
              amino acid composition of the different sequences was more
              uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic
              trees show that topologies can be different after removing
              conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly
              resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of
              animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal
              eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one
              presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of
              manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of
              phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and

               message queuing, and a TIBCO-based publish-subscribe
               architecture? See Chapter 9, Interlude: Composed Messaging.
               Utilizing years of practical experience, seasoned experts Gregor
               Hohpe and Bobby Woolf show how asynchronous messaging has proven
               to be the best strategy for enterprise integration success.
               However, building and deploying messaging solutions presents a
               number of problems for developers. Enterprise Integration
               Patterns provides an invaluable catalog of sixty-five patterns,
               with real-world solutions that demonstrate the formidable of
               messaging and help you to design effective messaging solutions
               for your enterprise. The authors also include examples covering
               a variety of different integration technologies, such as JMS,
               MSMQ, TIBCO ActiveEnterprise, Microsoft BizTalk, SOAP, and XSL.
               A case study describing a bond trading system illustrates the
               patterns in practice, and the book offers a look at emerging
               standards, as well as insights into what the future of
               enterprise integration might hold. This book provides a
               consistent vocabulary and visual notation framework to describe
               large-scale integration solutions across many technologies. It
               also explores in detail the advantages and limitations of
               asynchronous messaging architectures. The authors present
               practical advice on designing code that connects an application
               to a messaging system, and provide extensive information to help
               you determine when to send a message, how to route it to the
               proper destination, and how to monitor the health of a messaging
               system. If you want to know how to manage, monitor, and maintain
               a messaging system once it is in use, get this book.

  abstract = "The number of all possible linear and branched isomers of a
              hexasaccharide was calculated and found to be > 1.05 x 10(12).
              This large number defines the Isomer Barrier, a persistent
              technological barrier to the development of a single analytical
              method for the absolute characterization of carbohydrates,
              regardless of sample quantity. Because of this isomer barrier, no
              single method can be employed to determine complete
              oligosaccharide structure in 100 nmol amounts with the same
              assurance that can be achieved for 100 pmol amounts with
              single-procedure Edman peptide or Sanger DNA sequencing methods.
              Difficulties in the development of facile synthetic schemes for
              oligosaccharides are also explained by this large number. No
              current method of chemical or physical analysis has the
              resolution necessary to distinguish among 10(12) structures
              having the same mass. Therefore the 'characterization' of a
              middle-weight oligosaccharide solely by NMR or mass spectrometry
              necessarily contains a very large margin of error. Greater
              uncertainty accompanies results performed solely by sequential
              enzyme degradation followed by gel-permeation chromatography or
              electrophoresis, as touted by some commercial advertisements.
              Much of the literature which uses these single methods to
              'characterize' complex carbohydrates is, therefore, in question,
              and journals should beware of publishing structural
              characterizations unless the authors reveal all alternate
              possible structures which could result from their
              analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

               surprising origins of the world's most deadly viruses, and how
               we can overcome catastrophic pandemics. In The Viral Storm,
               award-winning biologist Nathan Wolfe tells the story of how
               viruses and human beings have evolved side by side through
               history; how deadly viruses like HIV, swine flu, and bird flu
               almost wiped us out in the past; and why modern life has made
               our species vulnerable to the threat of a global pandemic.
               Wolfe's research missions to the jungles of Africa and the rain
               forests of Borneo have earned him the nickname ``the Indiana
               Jones of virus hunters,'' and here Wolfe takes readers along on
               his groundbreaking and often dangerous research trips---to
               reveal the surprising origins of the most deadly diseases and to
               explain the role that viruses have played in human evolution. In
               a world where each new outbreak seems worse than the one before,
               Wolfe points the way forward, as new technologies are brought to
               bear in the most remote areas of the world to neutralize these
               viruses and even harness their power for the good of humanity.
               His provocative vision of the future will change the way we
               think about viruses, and perhaps remove a potential threat to

              methodology for the detection of these strains and L. rhamnosus
              GG (a commercially available intestinal probiotic) in the human
              vagina in order to assess probiotic persistence at this site. Ten
              healthy women inserted vaginally a capsule containing either a
              combination of strains GR-1 and RC-14 or the GG strain for 3
              consecutive nights. Vaginal swabs taken before and at various
              time points after probiotic insertion were analyzed, and the
              Lactobacillus flora was assessed by randomly amplified
              polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This method generated discrete
              DNA fingerprints for GR-1, RC-14, and GG and enabled successful
              detection of these strains in the vagina. Strain GR-1 and/or
              strain RC-14 was found to persist in the vaginal tract for up to
              19 days after vaginal instillation, while L. rhamnosus GG was
              detectable for up to 5 days postadministration. In conclusion,
              the fates of probiotic L. rhamnosus and L. fermentum strains were
              successfully monitored in the human vagina by RAPD analysis. This
              technique provides molecular biology-based evidence that RC-14
              and GR-1, strains selected as urogenital probiotics, persist in
              the human vagina and may be more suited to vaginal colonization
              than L. rhamnosus GG. This highlights the importance of proper
